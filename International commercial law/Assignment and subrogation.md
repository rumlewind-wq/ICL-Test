### **Assignment and Subrogation (Rome I – Art. 14)**

**Definition**  
Assignment and subrogation govern how contractual rights are **transferred** from one party to another. Rome I provides **choice-of-law rules** for the _relationship between assignor and assignee_ and the _relationship with the debtor_, but **does not regulate priority issues** between competing assignees.

## **Assignment (transfer of a claim)**

### **1. Law Governing the Assignor–Assignee Relationship**

- Governed by the **law applicable to the contract of assignment** (Art. 14(1)).
    
- Parties to the assignment (assignor + assignee) may choose the governing law under Art. 3.
    

**What this covers:**

- Validity of the assignment
    
- Rights and obligations between assignor and assignee
    
- Warranties, formalities, internal effects
    

---

### **2. Law Governing the Debtor–Assignee Relationship**

- Governed by the **law of the original contract** between debtor and assignor (Art. 14(2)).
    
- Protects the debtor from unexpected changes in governing law.
    

**What this covers:**

- Debtor’s defences
    
- Whether the debtor must accept the assignment
    
- Discharge by paying the assignor vs. the assignee
    
- Anti-assignment clauses (if governed by contract law)
    

---

### **3. What Rome I _does not_ regulate**

- **Priority between competing assignees**
    
- **Proprietary effects** of assignments (property law dimension)
    
- These remain subject to **domestic PIL rules**.
    
- The EU has not harmonised these issues.

## **Subrogation (transfer by operation of law)**

### **Definition**

Subrogation occurs when one party (**payer**) satisfies the debtor’s obligation and **steps into the creditor’s rights** by operation of law (e.g., insurer paying the insured).

### **Rome I Rule (Art. 15)**

The law governing the original obligation (the debtor–creditor relationship) also governs:

- Whether subrogation is allowed
    
- The scope and effect of subrogation
    
- Rights transferred to the subrogated party
    

---

## **What Assignment & Subrogation _are_**

- Mechanisms transferring claims and rights from one party to another.
    
- Covered partially by Rome I (internal effects; debtor protection).
    
- Key tools in finance, insurance, factoring, and secured transactions.
    

---

## **What They _are not_**

- Not harmonised in full under EU law.
    
- Not governed by the characteristic performance test.
    
- Not determinative of priority conflicts (domestic property law applies).
    
- Not always based on party autonomy (subrogation is typically non-contractual).

## **Examples**

### **Assignment Example**

A Spanish company assigns its receivable against a Danish buyer to a French bank.

- Law of assignment contract → chosen by assignor & assignee (e.g., French law).
    
- Law governing the receivable → law of underlying supply contract (e.g., Danish law).  
    Debtor’s rights remain governed by **Danish law**.
    

### **Subrogation Example**

A German insurer pays an insured’s claim and seeks recovery from a Polish tortfeasor.

- Subrogation governed by the law applicable to the original obligation (e.g., Polish tort law under Rome II).

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Assignment and subrogation under Rome I create a **dual-layer system**:

- The **assignment contract** is governed by its own chosen law,
    
- but the **debtor relationship** always stays under the law governing the original claim,  
    ensuring commercial predictability and debtor protection.
