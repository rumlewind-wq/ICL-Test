### **Arbitrability (general definition – limits on what can be submitted to arbitration)**

**Arbitrability** determines **which types of disputes may be resolved by arbitration**, as opposed to national courts.  
It defines the **subject-matter boundaries** of arbitration and protects areas considered too closely tied to **public interest**, **state authority**, or **third-party rights**.

It is a **threshold jurisdictional requirement** under both national arbitration laws and the New York Convention (Art. V(2)(a)).

## **Two Dimensions of Arbitrability**

### **1. Objective Arbitrability (subject-matter limits)**

Concerns **what** can be arbitrated.

States normally **exclude** disputes involving:

- **Criminal law**
    
- **Family law**
    
- **Insolvency / bankruptcy “collective” proceedings**
    
- **Competition fines / antitrust sanctions**
    
- **Administrative and regulatory matters**
    
- **Patent validity** (erga omnes effects; state/public-interest domain)
    
- **Corporate status / dissolution** (in some jurisdictions)
    
- **Markets requiring state supervision** (e.g., securities regulation)
    

Commercial and contractual matters are generally **arbitrable**.

### **2. Subjective Arbitrability (party capacity)**

Concerns **who** can arbitrate.

Limits may restrict arbitration by:

- **Minors**
    
- **Legally incapacitated persons**
    
- **Public authorities** (in some jurisdictions)
    
- **States** (need explicit waiver of immunity)

## **What Arbitrability _is_**

- A **legal boundary** ensuring arbitration does not intrude into areas requiring state oversight.
    
- A rule assessed by:  
    – **Lex arbitri** (law of the seat)  
    – **Law of the enforcement State** (NYC Art. V(2)(a))
    
- A **public policy filter** in both set-aside and enforcement proceedings.
    
- A condition for tribunal jurisdiction.
    

---

## **What Arbitrability _is not_**

- Not determined by the **lex contractus**.
    
- Not dependent on party agreement—consent cannot make a non-arbitrable matter arbitrable.
    
- Not a merits issue—purely jurisdictional.
    
- Not uniform globally; varies by State.
    

---

## **Interaction with Enforcement**

- Under **New York Convention Art. V(2)(a)**, enforcement may be refused if the subject matter is **not arbitrable** under the enforcing State’s law.
    
- Tribunals must consider arbitrability under **both** the seat’s law and potential enforcement jurisdictions.

## **Examples**

- **Arbitrable:**  
    – Contract breach  
    – Distribution, franchise, M&A disputes  
    – Construction disputes  
    – Shareholder disputes (in most jurisdictions)  
    – IP licensing  
    – Commercial torts
    
- **Non-arbitrable:**  
    – Patent validity erga omnes (public-interest domain)  
    – Divorce, custody, adoption  
    – Criminal sanctions  
    – Antitrust fines  
    – Insolvency proceedings with collective effects

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Arbitrability defines the **outer limits of private adjudication**. Only disputes falling within the scope of **arbitrable subject matter**—and involving **parties capable** of arbitration—may be referred to arbitral tribunals. Mandatory state interests and public-order domains remain **outside arbitration’s jurisdiction**, and courts enforce these limits at both the **seat** and **enforcement** stages.
