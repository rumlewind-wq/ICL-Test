Bier, Case 21/76

---

**Bier, Case 21/76** (Mines de Potasse d’Alsace)

  

The Court interpreted **Brussels I, art. 7(2)**, holding that in cross-border tort cases, the claimant may sue:

1. In the court of the place where the **harmful event originated** (place of the event giving rise to the damage), or
    
2. In the court of the place where the **damage occurred** (place where the damage was suffered).
    

  

This established the **double head of jurisdiction** rule, expanding options for plaintiffs and increasing procedural proximity.
