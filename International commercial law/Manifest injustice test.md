### **Manifest Injustice Test (general definition – exceptional review standard)**

The **manifest injustice test** is an **exceptionally narrow control mechanism** used by some courts or arbitral institutions to determine whether an outcome is so **egregiously unfair**, irrational, or contrary to fundamental legality that it cannot be allowed to stand—**without engaging in a full merits review**.  
It acts as a _minimal fairness safeguard_, not a substitute for appeal.

It appears in limited contexts, especially in **annulment**, **set-aside**, and certain **public policy** reviews.

## **Core Meaning**

A decision fails the manifest injustice test only if:

- The result is **so extreme** that no reasonable tribunal applying the correct procedure could have reached it.
    
- The award/judgment produces an outcome that is **intolerable**, arbitrary, or fundamentally inconsistent with basic justice.
    
- There is a **clear disconnect** between the decision and the evidence/procedure, amounting to a structural defect.
    

This is **not** merits review.  
Only outcomes that are _obviously unacceptable_ under fundamental legal standards trigger intervention.

## **Typical Use Cases**

### **1. Public policy review (NYC Art. V(2)(b))**

Courts sometimes require **manifest injustice or fundamental unfairness** before refusing enforcement on public policy grounds.

### **2. Set-aside proceedings**

Some jurisdictions treat _manifest injustice_ as indicating:

- violation of due process,
    
- ultra vires decision-making,
    
- arbitrary exercise of power.
    

### **3. Institutional award scrutiny**

Institutions like ICC (award scrutiny phase) prevent awards that would lead to **manifestly unjust** outcomes while avoiding merits substitution.

### **4. Equity-based corrective doctrines**

Very rare, but occasionally invoked in domestic enforcement where statutory wording requires a showing of “manifest injustice” to refuse enforcement.

## **What the Manifest Injustice Test _is_**

- A **minimal fairness threshold** in exceptional cases.
    
- A check for **extreme and obvious unfairness**, not minor errors.
    
- A doctrine preventing courts or arbitrators from endorsing decisions that are **procedurally valid but substantively intolerable**.
    
- A last-resort safeguard when no other remedy is available.
    

---

## **What It _is not_**

- Not a mechanism for revisiting the merits.
    
- Not a general appeal or review of correctness.
    
- Not triggered by:  
    – errors of law,  
    – evidentiary mistakes,  
    – simple miscalculations,  
    – poor reasoning.
    
- Not recognised uniformly across jurisdictions—applies only where explicit or implicitly embedded in public policy analysis.
    

---

## **Examples**

- Award grants damages **without any evidentiary basis** → may meet manifest injustice threshold.
    
- Tribunal ignores a party entirely, refusing to hear evidence → due process violation equals manifest injustice.
    
- Judgment imposes liability where the defendant was never notified of proceedings → manifest injustice under due process standards.
    
- Award contradicts basic fundamental values (e.g., enforcing blatantly illegal contract) → manifest injustice via public policy.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

The manifest injustice test is an **exceptional corrective doctrine** used only when an enforcement or annulment court faces a decision that is **procedurally valid on paper but substantively intolerable**. It is _not_ a merits review—it is a **last line of defence** to prevent outcomes incompatible with the most basic standards of justice and public policy.
