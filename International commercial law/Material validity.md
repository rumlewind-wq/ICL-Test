**Material validity (in international arbitration)**  
Material validity concerns the **substantive legality** of the arbitration agreement and the arbitral award. It evaluates whether the award is **legally valid in substance**, not merely compliant with formal requirements.

It deals with **what** the tribunal decided and **whether it had the legal authority to decide it**.

### **Core Components of Material Validity**

- **Valid arbitration agreement**  
    The arbitration clause must be:  
    – Substantively valid under the law chosen by the parties, or  
    – Failing that, under the law of the seat (lex arbitri) or the law of the contract (container contract logic).
    
- **Tribunal’s jurisdiction**  
    Tribunal must stay within the scope of:  
    – The arbitration agreement  
    – The parties’ submissions  
    – Issues expressly referred for decision  
    (Excess of mandate = material invalidity).
    
- **Arbitrability**  
    The subject matter must be capable of arbitration:  
    – Non-arbitrable matters (e.g., certain insolvency, criminal, family issues) render the award materially invalid.
    
- **Public policy compliance**  
    Award must not violate the forum’s or the seat’s public policy:  
    – Corruption  
    – Fraud  
    – Due process denial  
    – Fundamental procedural unfairness
    
- **Substantive legality of the decision**  
    Decision must not contravene:  
    – Mandatory rules of the seat  
    – Mandatory rules of the enforcement state  
    – Mandatory rules of the governing law of the contract

### **What Material Validity _is_**

- Substantive validity of the arbitration agreement and award.
    
- Assessment of jurisdiction, arbitrability, and substantive legality.
    
- A basis for annulment under **Model Law Art. 34** and refusal of enforcement under **NYC Art. V(1)(a), (c), (d), (2)**.

### **What Material Validity _is not_**

- Not related to formatting, signatures, written form, reasons (those are _formal validity_).
    
- Not a merits review—courts do _not_ evaluate if the tribunal “got the law right”.
    
- Not linked to documentary requirements (those relate to enforcement procedure).

### **Interaction with Key Instruments**

- **Model Law Art. 34**  
    Grounds linked to material invalidity:  
    – Invalid arbitration agreement  
    – Excess of jurisdiction  
    – Non-arbitrability  
    – Public policy
    
- **NYC Art. V**  
    Mirrors these protections on the enforcement side.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Material validity checks whether the **award is legally sound in substance**: jurisdictionally correct, arbitrable, grounded in a valid arbitration agreement, and compliant with public policy. Without material validity, the award may be **annulled at the seat** or **refused enforcement globally**.
