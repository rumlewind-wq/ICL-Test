**Awards (general definition in international arbitration)**  
Awards are **authoritative decisions issued by an arbitral tribunal** that resolve issues submitted by the parties. They function as the arbitration-equivalent of court judgments and operate as the **formal output** of the arbitral process. Awards can address the **merits, procedure, jurisdiction, costs, remedies, or settlement formalisation**, depending on type.

**Operational characteristics**

- **Binding** on the parties once issued.
- **Final or non-final**, depending on scope and lex arbitri.
- **Enforceable** under the New York Convention when they meet formal validity and due-process standards.
- **Subject to supervision** by courts at the seat (annulment, assistance, correction).
- **Carry res judicata effect**, preventing re-litigation of decided matters.

**Common features across award types**

- Issued in **writing**.
- Signed by tribunal members (unless lex arbitri allows exceptions).
- Contain **reasons**, unless waived.

- Delivered to parties formally.
    
- Governed in validity terms by the **lex arbitri** (seat law).
    
- Govern enforcement by the **New York Convention** or domestic arbitration statutes.
    

**Purpose in dispute resolution**  
Awards operationalise the tribunal’s adjudicative mandate and convert the parties’ dispute into a legally enforceable outcome. They are the end-stage deliverable of any arbitration, functioning domestically and internationally as the arbitral system’s analogue to judicial judgments.
