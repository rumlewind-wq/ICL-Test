### **Res Judicata (general definition – international litigation & arbitration)**

**Res judicata** is the principle that a **final and binding decision** (court judgment or arbitral award) **cannot be re-litigated** between the same parties on the same cause of action or issues.  
It ensures **finality**, **legal certainty**, and **procedural efficiency**.

## **Core Elements (classical tripartite test)**

A prior decision has res judicata effect when:

1. **Same parties**  
    – Identity of the parties (or their legal successors).
    
2. **Same cause of action / same claim**  
    – The same underlying right or obligation.
    
3. **Same object / same relief sought**  
    – Claimant seeks essentially the same remedy.
    

If all three align → subsequent proceedings must be dismissed or limited.

## **Material vs. Formal Res Judicata**

- **Formal res judicata**  
    The decision is final and no longer subject to appeal or modification.
    
- **Material res judicata**  
    The decision binds the parties **in future proceedings**, preventing re-litigation of decided matters.
    

Arbitral awards and court judgments both carry **material** res judicata effect.

## **Issue Estoppel (subset of res judicata)**

Some legal systems also protect **issues** already decided (even if the claim differs).  
This may apply in arbitration depending on the governing procedural law.

## **Res Judicata in International Arbitration**

- Arbitral awards—once final—carry **res judicata** effect globally.
    
- Enforcement courts under the NYC treat the award as **binding** (Art. V(1)(e)).
    
- A second arbitration on the same claim may be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction or abuse of process.
    

**Key point:**  
Res judicata applies even if proceedings occur in **different jurisdictions**.

---

## **What Res Judicata _is_**

- A rule of **finality** preventing repeated litigation.
    
- A doctrine ensuring **procedural economy** and **consistency** of outcomes.
    
- A mechanism attaching to both **state judgments** and **arbitral awards**.
    
- A principle recognised almost universally across jurisdictions.
    

---

## **What It _is not_**

- Not a merits review – it does not check correctness of the prior decision.
    
- Not dependent on identical _legal grounds_—focus is on claim/relief/parties.
    
- Not affected by different procedural forums (court vs arbitration).
    
- Not a bar to enforcement—NYC recognises prior awards as binding.
    

---

## **Practical Examples**

- Tribunal issues a **final award** dismissing a damages claim.  
    → Claimant cannot re-file the same damages claim in another arbitration.
    
- Court judgment in France decides liability under a contract.  
    → Same issue cannot be litigated again in a later action in Germany.
    
- Arbitration resolves whether an agreement is valid.  
    → Parties cannot challenge validity again before courts (unless annulment grounds apply).

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Res judicata gives **final and binding effect** to judgments and arbitral awards, prohibiting re-litigation of the same dispute. It protects procedural integrity, stabilises commercial relationships, and ensures that once a claim has been adjudicated, it **stays closed**.
