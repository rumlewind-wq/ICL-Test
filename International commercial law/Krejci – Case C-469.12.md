Krejci, Case C-469/12


----
**Krejci, Case C-469/12**

  

The Court clarified that under **Brussels I, art. 7(1)(b)**, when a contract covers **both goods and services**, the court must determine which element is **predominant**:

- If **goods** are predominant → jurisdiction lies where the goods were delivered or should have been delivered.
    
- If **services** are predominant → jurisdiction lies where the services were provided or should have been provided.
    

  

This prevents forum shopping and ensures a **single main place of performance** for mixed contracts.
