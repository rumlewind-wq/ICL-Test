### **Escape Clause – Closer Connection (Rome I / Rome Convention)**

**Definition**  
The _escape clause – closer connection_ is a **corrective mechanism** allowing a court to **displace the default connecting factor** under Rome I (e.g., characteristic performance) when another country is **manifestly more closely connected** to the contract.

---

### **Core Function**

- Ensures the **most appropriate law** applies when the default rule would produce an artificial or commercially incorrect outcome.
    
- Operates as a **safety valve** to preserve substantive coherence in cross-border contracts.
    

---

### **Legal Basis**

- **Rome I, Art. 4(3)**  
    Allows departure from Art. 4(1) or 4(2) where the contract is **manifestly more closely connected** with another country.
    
- Mirrors the **Rome Convention Art. 4(5)** approach.

### **Operational Indicators of a Closer Connection**

Courts look at objective, contract-specific factors such as:

- **Common habitual residence** of the parties
    
- **Place of performance of the characteristic obligations**
    
- **Pre-existing commercial relationship governed by the same law**
    
- **Contract forming part of a broader transaction governed by one law**
    
- **Heavily centralised operational and risk profile in one jurisdiction**
    

---

### **What It _is_**

- A **corrective override** to avoid misapplication of the default rule.
    
- A tool for aligning the applicable law with the **economic reality** of the transaction.
    
- A flexible mechanism grounded in **objective indications**, not party preference.
    

---

### **What It _is not_**

- Not a general discretion for courts.
    
- Not a mechanism for choosing more favourable law.
    
- Not applicable when parties have made a **valid choice of law** (Art. 3).
    

---

### **Examples**

- A distribution contract formally performed in State A but operationally controlled, executed, and risk-managed entirely in State B.
    
- A contract embedded in a long-term relationship where all prior agreements were governed by one law.
    
- A multi-contract corporate transaction where the disputed agreement is economically inseparable from others governed by the same law.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

The escape clause realigns the applicable law with the **true centre of gravity** of the transaction. It overrides default rules only when the contract’s **commercial, operational, and structural links** visibly point to a different jurisdiction.
