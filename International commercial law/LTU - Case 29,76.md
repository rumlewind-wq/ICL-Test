LTU, Case 29/76


**Case 29/76, LTU v. Eurocontrol (1976)**

- **Facts:** Eurocontrol, an intergovernmental air navigation safety organization, levied charges on airlines for air traffic control services. LTU, a German airline, challenged these charges before a national court, arguing they violated EU law.
    
- **Issue:** Whether Eurocontrol qualified as an _undertaking_ under EU competition law (Art. 102 TFEU, then Art. 86 EEC).
    
- **Ruling:** The ECJ held Eurocontrol was **not an undertaking**. It exercised powers of a public authority in managing airspace and air traffic safety. Its activities were non-economic because they were based on regulatory and safety considerations, not market competition.
    
- **Principle:** Bodies exercising **public authority functions** fall outside EU competition rules, even if they charge fees to cover costs.
    
- **Key reasoning:**
    
    - Eurocontrol had no profit motive.
        
    - Fees were compulsory, non-negotiable, and linked to public regulatory tasks.
        
    - Distinction between **economic activity** and **sovereign functions** established.
        

**Significance:**

First major case defining “undertaking” narrowly, excluding public authorities acting in a regulatory capacity. Foundation for later cases like _MOTOE_ (C-49/07) and _SELEX_ (C-113/07).
