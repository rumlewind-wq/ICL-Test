Color Drack, Case C-204/08


----
**Color Drack, Case C-204/08**

  

The Court held that under **Brussels I, art. 7(1)(b)** for **sale of goods**, when there are **multiple delivery locations within one Member State**, jurisdiction is in the courts of:

- The **principal place of delivery**, determined by the parties’ agreement or, if unclear, based on factual criteria such as the most significant delivery location.
    

  

If no principal place can be identified, the claimant may sue in **any delivery location** within that Member State.

This rule ensures **predictability** and limits excessive forum shopping.
