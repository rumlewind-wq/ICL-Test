**Seat of arbitration (general definition)**  
The _seat of arbitration_ is the **legal home** of the arbitration. It determines the **lex arbitri**, the **supervisory courts**, the **nationality of the award**, and the **procedural framework** that governs the arbitration.

It is a **legal, not geographical**, concept.

### **Core Functions**

- **Determines the lex arbitri**  
    The seat’s arbitration law governs:  
    – Tribunal constitution  
    – Due process standards  
    – Interim measures  
    – Challenges to arbitrators  
    – Annulment procedures  
    – Formal and material validity of the award
    
- **Identifies supervisory courts**  
    Courts of the seat have exclusive authority over:  
    – Annulment (Model Law Art. 34)  
    – Certain procedural interventions  
    – Judicial assistance (e.g., appointment of arbitrators)
    
- **Defines the nationality of the award**  
    Relevant for:  
    – **New York Convention** nationality test (Art. I(1))  
    – Enforcement strategy  
    – Public policy assessment
    
- **Anchors procedural law**  
    Even in institutional arbitration (ICC, LCIA, SCC), the rules are **subordinate** to mandatory provisions of the seat.

### **What the Seat _is_**

- A **juridical anchor** for the arbitration.
    
- The **source of mandatory procedural rules**.
    
- The **location** of annulment and supervisory jurisdiction.
    
- The determinant of the award’s **“nationality”** for enforcement purposes.

### **What It _is not_**

- Not the physical place where hearings occur (hearings may be elsewhere).
    
- Not dictated by the governing law of the contract (_lex contractus_).
    
- Not overridden by institutional rules (institutions administer; they do not supply lex arbitri).
    
- Not the same as the venue/logistics of the arbitration.

### **Examples**

- Arbitration clause: “Seat: **London**; Rules: LCIA; Governing law: New York law.”  
    – **Seat**: London  
    – **Lex arbitri**: English Arbitration Act 1996  
    – **Supervisory court**: English High Court
    
- ICC arbitration with hearings in Dubai but seat in Paris.  
    – Award is a **French** award.  
    – Annulment only in France.  
    – NYC enforcement treats it as a French award.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

The seat of arbitration defines the **legal infrastructure** of the arbitration. It determines procedural law, court supervision, and the enforceability profile of the award. All strategic decisions—from drafting to enforcement—pivot around the selected seat.
