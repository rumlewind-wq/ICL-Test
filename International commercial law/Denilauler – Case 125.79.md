Denilauler, Case 125/79

----

### **Denilauler, Case 125/79**

  

**Facts**

- French creditor obtained an _ex parte_ order in France for the seizure of assets located in the Netherlands.
    
- The debtor had not been heard before the order was granted.
    
- Issue: Whether this provisional, _ex parte_ order could be recognized and enforced under the Brussels Convention.
    

---

**Legal Question**

- Does the Brussels Convention apply to provisional measures granted without the defendant being heard, i.e., without respecting adversarial principles?
    

---

**Holding (ECJ)**

- _Ex parte_ provisional measures **do not fall** under the automatic recognition and enforcement system of the Brussels Convention.
    
- Recognition and enforcement require that the defendant has been given the opportunity to present their case (adversarial principle).
    

---

**Key Legal Principle**

- Mutual trust under Brussels I requires that judgments are given **after proper hearing of both parties**.
    
- Provisional measures ordered without hearing the defendant cannot be enforced automatically in another Member State.
    
- Such measures may still be enforced **under national law**, but not under Brussels I rules.
    

---

**Relevance**

- Confirms procedural safeguards in cross-border enforcement.
    
- Today reflected in **Art. 2(a) and Art. 42(2)** of Brussels I Recast: judgments must be enforceable and respect rights of defense.
    
- Limits scope of automatic recognition for urgent measures.
