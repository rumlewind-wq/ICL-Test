### **Patent Validity Disputes (state/public-interest character – arbitrability limits)**

**Definition**  
Patent validity disputes involve determining whether a **patent is valid, invalid, or should be revoked**. Because patent rights are **granted by the State**, questions of validity typically involve **public-interest considerations**, making them **non-arbitrable** or only **partially arbitrable** in many jurisdictions.

They sit at the border between **private rights** and **public regulatory authority**.

## **Why Patent Validity Is Considered Public-Interest / State Domain**

- **Patents are state-granted monopolies** → validity determines whether exclusive rights exist in the market.
    
- **Revocation affects third parties** (competitors, innovation ecosystem).
    
- **Uniformity concerns** → contradictory arbitral decisions would undermine certainty.
    
- **Regulatory oversight** → state patent offices or specialised courts maintain patent registers.
    

As a result, patent validity is often **reserved for national courts or patent offices**, not private arbitrators.

## **Global Position (typical approach)**

### **1. Non-arbitrable validity (majority view)**

- Arbitration **cannot revoke** or declare a patent invalid **erga omnes** (against all).
    
- Only **state courts** or **patent authorities** can issue such rulings.
    
- Arbitrators may assess **validity defensively** (e.g., as a defence in infringement or licence disputes), but their decision binds **only the parties**, not the patent register.
    

### **2. Arbitrable licensing and infringement disputes**

Arbitration is fully allowed for:

- Royalty payments
    
- Licence interpretation
    
- Contractual warranties
    
- Infringement between parties
    
- Damages between parties
    

But not the **public law** question of patent existence.

## **What Patent Validity Disputes _are_**

- **State-linked adjudications** affecting the patent register.
    
- Matters involving **public interest**, regulatory oversight, and third-party effects.
    
- Disputes that often fall under **exclusive jurisdiction of national courts**.
    
- Issues that may be **raised** in arbitration only defensively (no erga omnes effect).
    

---

## **What They _are not_**

- Not purely private commercial disputes—cannot be treated like ordinary contract matters.
    
- Not automatically arbitrable even with party consent.
    
- Not determinative of patent registers—arbitral awards **cannot** delete or alter patents.
    
- Not capable of producing effects against third parties.
    

---

## **Examples**

- Arbitrator may decide:  
    “Licensee owes royalties _even if_ it alleges the patent is invalid.”  
    → Validity addressed _inter partes_ only, not erga omnes.
    
- Arbitrator **cannot** order:  
    “The patent is invalid and removed from the patent register.”  
    → Must be decided by the national patent office or specialised court.
    
- A party challenges validity as a defence in an infringement arbitration → tribunal may evaluate validity only as part of resolving **contractual consequences**, not for public-law revocation.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Patent validity disputes occupy the **public-interest domain** because patents are **state-granted rights** with effects on the market and third parties. Arbitrators may examine validity **only incidentally and inter partes**, but decisions on **revocation, erga omnes invalidity, or register changes** remain strictly within the jurisdiction of **state courts and patent authorities**.
