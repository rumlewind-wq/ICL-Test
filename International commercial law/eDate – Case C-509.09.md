**eDate, Case C-509/09**

  

The Court ruled that under **Brussels I, art. 7(2)**, in cases of defamation via online content, the claimant has **three jurisdiction options**:

1. **Defendant’s domicile** – for full damages.
    
2. **Each Member State where content is accessible** – but only for damages suffered in that state (**Shevill rule**).
    
3. **Claimant’s center of interests** – a new criterion, allowing jurisdiction for **full damages** where the claimant has their main reputation and social/professional life.
    

  

This expanded jurisdiction for online defamation to address the borderless nature of the internet.
