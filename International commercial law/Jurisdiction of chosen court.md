**Jurisdiction of the chosen court (exclusive choice of court agreements)**  
The **jurisdiction of the chosen court** refers to the **mandatory obligation** of the designated court to hear and decide the dispute when the parties have entered into an **exclusive choice of court agreement**.

It operationalises party autonomy by compelling the chosen court to exercise jurisdiction.

### **Core Principle**

- **Chosen court must hear the case**  
    Under instruments such as **Brussels Ia Art. 25** and **2005 Hague Convention Art. 5**, the selected court **cannot decline jurisdiction** (except in narrow situations like nullity of the clause).

### **Operational Effects**

- **Automatic jurisdiction**  
    The chosen court acquires _direct jurisdiction_ by virtue of the clause alone.
    
- **No forum non conveniens**  
    Courts subject to Brussels Ia and Hague 2005 **cannot** refuse jurisdiction on convenience grounds.
    
- **Precedence over other jurisdictional bases**  
    The chosen court’s jurisdiction overrides:  
    – General jurisdiction (domicile)  
    – Special jurisdiction (contract/tort)  
    – Residual jurisdiction  
    – Asymmetric national rules
    
- **Duty to examine valid consent**  
    The chosen court must confirm the clause is:  
    – Formally valid  
    – Substantively valid  
    – Not defective due to fraud, incapacity, or lack of consent  
    (e.g., _Brussels Ia_ requires real consent).

### **What Jurisdiction of the Chosen Court _is_**

- Mandatory acceptance of jurisdiction by the designated court.
    
- A direct effect of party autonomy in cross-border disputes.
    
- A mechanism ensuring centralisation of litigation in the agreed forum.
    
- A jurisdictional priority rule overriding other bases of jurisdiction.

### **What It _is not_**

- Not discretionary.
    
- Not dependent on the domicile of the parties.
    
- Not subject to parallel proceedings rules (lis pendens) that could displace the chosen court.  
    – Under **2005 Hague Convention**, the chosen court is protected.  
    – Under **Brussels Ia**, chosen-court priority applies even if another court was seized first.

### **Effects on Other Courts**

- **Non-chosen courts must decline jurisdiction**  
    (Brussels Ia Art. 25; Hague 2005 Art. 6).
    
- Proceedings brought elsewhere can be dismissed, stayed, or treated as inadmissible.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Jurisdiction of the chosen court is a **mandatory adjudicative obligation** created by an exclusive choice of court clause. The court must hear the dispute, cannot decline on convenience grounds, and becomes the primary forum for all litigation under the agreement.
