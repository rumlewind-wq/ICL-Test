Shevill, Case C-68/93

---
**Shevill, Case C-68/93**

  

The Court held that under **Brussels I, art. 7(2)** (tort jurisdiction) for **defamation via printed media**, the claimant can:

1. **Sue in the place where the publisher is established** – for **full damages**.
    
2. **Sue in each Member State where the publication was distributed** – but only for damages **caused in that specific state**.
    

  

This established the **mosaic approach**, limiting local courts’ jurisdiction to harm occurring within their territory.
