### **Arbitration Agreement (general definition)**

An arbitration agreement is a **contractual commitment** by which parties agree to submit present or future disputes to **arbitration instead of national courts**. It is the legal foundation of arbitral jurisdiction.

It may appear as a **clause in a contract** or as a **stand-alone submission agreement**.

## **Core Characteristics**

- **Private jurisdiction agreement**  
    Parties confer adjudicative power on an arbitral tribunal rather than state courts.
    
- **Two forms**
    
    - **Clause compromis** → arbitration clause in a commercial contract.
        
    - **Compromis** → stand-alone agreement after a dispute has arisen.
        
- **Binding and enforceable**  
    Recognised globally under the **New York Convention (Art. II)** and national arbitration statutes.
    
- **Subject to separability**  
    Protected by the **[[Separability doctrine]]**, meaning it survives challenges to the main contract.
    
- **Tribunal decides jurisdiction**  
    Backed by the **[[Competence-competence doctrine]]** (Model Law Art. 16).

## **What an Arbitration Agreement _is_**

- A **jurisdictional gateway** transferring dispute resolution to arbitration.
    
- A legally autonomous agreement determining:  
    – The forum (arbitration)  
    – The scope of arbitrable issues  
    – The procedural framework (institutional/ad hoc rules)  
    – The seat, tribunal composition, and related mechanics
    
- A **mandatory basis** for courts to:  
    – Refer disputes to arbitration  
    – Decline jurisdiction (NYC Art. II(3))  
    – Enforce resulting awards

## **What It _is not_**

- Not the same as the **main contract** (protected by separability).
    
- Not a choice-of-law clause (though it often coexists with one).
    
- Not dependent on the governing law of the contract unless expressly chosen (lex arbitri governs most procedural issues).
    
- Not optional once agreed—parties cannot unilaterally revoke it.

## **Formal Requirements**

- **In writing** (NYC Art. II)  
    Includes modern forms: email, electronic communication, durable medium.
    
- **Clear consent**  
    Courts look for unequivocal intention to arbitrate; ambiguity may render it **pathological** (see [[Pathological arbitration clauses]]).

## **Substantive Scope**

Typically covers:

- Contractual disputes
    
- Tort claims connected to the contract
    
- Statutory claims tied to the contractual relationship
    
- Termination, validity, performance, non-performance, misrepresentation
    

Scope interpretation is usually **pro-arbitration**.

---

## **Institutional vs Ad Hoc**

- **Institutional arbitration** (see [[Institutional arbitration]])  
    Administered under rules (ICC, LCIA, SCC, DIA, SIAC).
    
- **Ad hoc arbitration** (see [[Ad hoc arbitration]])  
    Self-managed by parties; often uses UNCITRAL Rules.
    

---

## **Examples**

- “All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be finally settled by arbitration under the ICC Rules, seat Paris.”
    
- “Any dispute shall be referred to ad hoc arbitration in Copenhagen under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.”

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

The arbitration agreement is the **jurisdictional backbone** of arbitration. It operates as an autonomous, enforceable commitment that shifts dispute resolution from courts to tribunals, supported by separability, competence-competence, and the global enforcement regime of the New York Convention.
