Martinez, Case C 161/10

**Martinez, Case C-161/10**

  

The Court held that under **Brussels I, art. 7(2)** (tort jurisdiction), a person claiming defamation from content published online may bring proceedings:

- **Either** in the courts of the Member State where the **publisher is established**, for **full damages**, or
    
- **In any Member State where the online content is accessible**, but only for damages caused in that specific state.
    

  

The Court confirmed that accessibility of the website is the decisive factor, not targeting. This clarified and extended the **Shevill** rule to online publications.
