Falco Privatstiftung, Case C-533/07


----
**Falco Privatstiftung, Case C-533/07**

  

The Court interpreted **Brussels I, art. 7(1)(b)** regarding **licensing agreements**.

  

**Facts:**

- An Austrian foundation (Falco) granted a German company rights to exploit audiovisual works under a **licensing contract**.
    
- Dispute arose about payment obligations and whether this was a **service contract** under art. 7(1)(b).
    

  

**Holding:**

- A **licensing agreement** does **not** qualify as a “contract for services” because the licensor **does not perform an active obligation**, only grants a right of use.
    
- Art. 7(1)(b) applies **only** to active performance obligations.
    
- Therefore, jurisdiction must be determined under **art. 7(1)(a)** using the general “place of performance” rule.
    

  

**Significance:**

- Narrowed the scope of “services” under Brussels I.
    
- Clarified that passive obligations, like granting IP rights, do not trigger the special jurisdiction for services.
    
- Maintained **predictability** by requiring standard contractual jurisdiction rules for licensing disputes.
