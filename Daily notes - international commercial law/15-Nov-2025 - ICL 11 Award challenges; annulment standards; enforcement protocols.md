### Attempts to set aside the award

- Jurisdictional grounds
	- Usually, objections are made at the beginning of the arbitration process, Model Law, art. 16
	- If objections are made after the award has been delivered, a party risks to lose the right to object
	- Excession of power/ competence
	- Issues decided that were not covered by the arbitration agreement
	- Invalid arbitration agreement

### Attempts to set aside the award

- Procedural grounds, Model Law, art. 34, 2, a:
	- (i), invalid arbitration agreement
	- (ii) the party making the application was not given proper notice of the appointment of an arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case(undue process)
	- (iii) the award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration, provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted, only that part of the award which contains decisions on matters not submitted to arbitration may be set aside; or
