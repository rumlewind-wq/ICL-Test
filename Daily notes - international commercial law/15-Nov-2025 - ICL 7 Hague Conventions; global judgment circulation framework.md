### Questions, lecture 6

1. Explain the nature and structure of the Hague 2005 Choice of Court Convention.

2. Explain the nature and structure of the Hague 2019 Judgments Convention

3. When comparing the Conventions, how are their scopes of application?

4. Why should the two Hague Conventions be seen as a package?

5. How do the two Conventions differ in terms of jurisdiction and recognition and enforcement?

### Case 1, lecture 6

Business A from Mexico and Business B from Singa-pore entered into a commercial contract. The contract also had a clause according to which the courts of the UK are to have exclusive jurisdiction in disputes arising out of or relating to the contract

1) Do the British courts have jurisdiction?

2) What happens if A institute courts proceedings in the Uk and B in Singapore?

3) Can a judgment from the UK be recognised and enforced in respectively Mexico and Singapore or,for that matter, in Germany?

### Case 2, lecture 6

1) Can B sue A in Ukraine under the Hague 2005 Choice of Court Convention and have the judgment recognised and enforced in Uruguay?

2) Can B sue A in Ukraine under the Hague 2019 Judgments Convention and have the judgment recognised and enforced in Uruguay?
