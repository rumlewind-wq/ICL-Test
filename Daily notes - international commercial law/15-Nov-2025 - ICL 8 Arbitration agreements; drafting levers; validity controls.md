### The arbitration agreement

- Model law, art. 7(1)

"Arbitration agreement" is an agreement by the parties to submit to arbitration all or certain disputes which have arisen or which may arise between them in respect of a defined legal relationship, whether con-tractual or not. An arbitration agreement may be in the form of an arbitration clause in a contract or in the form of a separate agreement.

### The arbitration agreement

###### - Separability

- The arbitration agreement is separated from the commercial contract(text-book: container contract)
- Purpose, invalidity of the commercial contract does not affect the validity of the arbitration agreement

###### - Model law, art. 16(1)

 The arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement. For that purpose, an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. A decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause.

### The arbitration agreement

- Validity
	- Consent and formal requirements

- The New York Convention(NYC), art. II

1. Each Contracting State shall recognize an agreement in writing under which the parties undertake to submit to arbitration all or any differences which have arisen or which may arise between them in respect of a defined legal relationship, whether contractual or not,concerning a subject matter capable of settlement by arbitration.

2. The term"agreement in writing" shall include an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement, signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams.

### The arbitration agreement

· NYC art II(3)

### Drafting the Arbitration Agreement

- Ad hoc-arbitration agreement

 UNCITRAL Ad hoc arbitration model clause for contracts

 Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof, shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.

Note. Parties should consider adding:

(a) The appointing authority shall be...[name of institution or person];

(b) The number of arbitrators shall be....[one or three];

(c) The place of arbitration shall be...[town andcountry];

(d) The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be.$$\ldots$$

### Drafting the Arbitration Agreement

- Institutional arbitration agreement

 Standard ICC Arbitration Clause

 **All disputes arising out of or in connection with the present contract shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said Rules**.

Parties are free to adapt the clause to their particular circumstances. For instance, they may wish to stipulate the number of arbitrators given that the ICC Arbitration Rules contain a presumption in favour of a sole arbitrator.

Also, it may be desirable for them to stipulate the place and language of the arbitration and the law applicable to the merits. The ICC Arbitration Rules do not limit the parties' free choice of the place and language of the arbitration or the law governing the contract.
