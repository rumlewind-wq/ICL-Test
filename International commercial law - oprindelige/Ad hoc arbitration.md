**Ad hoc arbitration (general definition)**  
Ad hoc arbitration is an **arbitration process not administered by an arbitral institution**. The parties conduct the arbitration themselves, using either:

- **their own procedural framework**, or
    
- **a set of external rules** (most commonly the **UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules**).
    

It is a **party-driven**, flexible, and non-institutional model.

### **Core Characteristics**

- **No administering institution**  
    No ICC, LCIA, SCC, or other body supervising deadlines, fees, or procedures.
    
- **Parties control procedure**  
    Parties and the tribunal determine:  
    – Procedural timetable  
    – Appointment and replacement of arbitrators  
    – Fees, logistics, document production  
    – Hearing management
    
- **Seat-driven supervision**  
    Courts at the **seat of arbitration** provide oversight under the **lex arbitri** (e.g., Model Law).
    
- **Rules optional**  
    Parties may adopt:  
    – **UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules** (most common)  
    – Tailored procedural rules  
    – Domestic arbitration statutes  
    Or proceed with **no predefined rules**.

### **What Ad Hoc Arbitration _is_**

- Non-institutional, **self-managed** arbitration.
    
- Fully valid and enforceable under the **New York Convention**.
    
- Highly flexible and cost-controllable.
    
- Supervised only by the courts of the seat.

### **What It _is not_**

- Not **institutional arbitration** (no secretariat, no case manager).
    
- Not subject to **institutional rules** unless parties adopt them voluntarily.
    
- Not inherently cheaper or faster—depends on party discipline.
    
- Not exempt from **lex arbitri** or due process requirements.
    

---

### **Examples**

- Parties agree: “Disputes shall be settled by **ad hoc arbitration in Copenhagen** under the **UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules**.”
    
- Parties run an arbitration without institutional involvement, appointing their own tribunal and designing procedure from scratch.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Ad hoc arbitration is a **self-administered dispute-resolution model** offering maximum procedural autonomy and minimal institutional structure, with the **lex arbitri** providing the mandatory legal framework and the **UNCITRAL Rules** serving as the default procedural architecture when chosen.
