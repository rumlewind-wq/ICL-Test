### **Subject-Matter Non-Arbitrable – Model Law Art. 34(2)(b)(i)**

**Definition**  
Under **UNCITRAL Model Law Art. 34(2)(b)(i)**, an arbitral award may be **set aside** if _“the subject-matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law of this State.”_  
This is the Model Law’s **objective arbitrability test**.

It asks whether the **type of dispute itself** is legally permitted to be resolved by arbitration.

## **Core Meaning**

A court may annul an award if the dispute concerns a **non-arbitrable subject-matter**, typically involving:

- **Public regulatory authority**
    
- **Third-party or erga omnes effects**
    
- **Non-disposable rights**
    
- **Exclusive state jurisdiction**
    

If the dispute falls into a non-arbitrable category → **award is voidable** at the seat.

## **What Art. 34(2)(b)(i) _is_**

- A **seat-law control mechanism** ensuring arbitrators do not adjudicate prohibited subject areas.
    
- A ground for **annulment** (set-aside).
    
- A mandatory rule—parties **cannot contract around** it.
    
- A check on **objective arbitrability**.

## **What It _is not_**

- Not a merits review (no review of correctness).
    
- Not subjective arbitrability (capacity of parties).
    
- Not identical to public policy (that is Art. 34(2)(b)(ii)).
    
- Not dependent on the lex contractus.

## **Common Non-Arbitrable Subject-Matter Examples**

(assessed under the **law of the seat**)

- **Criminal liability and penal sanctions**
    
- **Family law and personal status**
    
- **Insolvency/bankruptcy proceedings with collective effects**
    
- **Patent validity (erga omnes)**
    
- **Administrative or regulatory acts**
    
- **Antitrust/competition fines**
    
- **Certain corporate matters** (status, dissolution)
    
- **Non-disposable consumer or employment rights** (varies)
    

Commercial disputes remain arbitrable unless expressly excluded.

## **Practical Example**

An arbitral tribunal issues an award declaring a **patent invalid** (erga omnes effect).  
→ Under many seat laws, patent validity is **non-arbitrable**.  
→ National court sets aside the award under **Art. 34(2)(b)(i)**.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Art. 34(2)(b)(i) empowers courts to **annul awards** when the dispute concerns **non-arbitrable subject-matter** under the law of the seat. It is a **mandatory jurisdictional limit**, ensuring arbitration does not intrude into domains reserved for **exclusive state authority**.
