**Formal validity (in international arbitration)**  
Formal validity refers to the **minimum formal requirements** an arbitral award must satisfy under the _lex arbitri_ and the **New York Convention** in order to be **legally effective, challenge-proof, and enforceable**.

It is the tribunal’s _compliance checklist_ ensuring the award is procedurally sound.

### **Core Elements of Formal Validity**

- **Written form**  
    Award must be in writing. Oral awards have no legal effect.
    
- **Signature(s) of arbitrators**  
    All arbitrators normally sign; the lex arbitri may allow:  
    – Majority signatures with explanation of missing signature  
    – Omission where arbitrator refuses to sign  
    (e.g., Model Law Art. 31(1)).
    
- **Reasoned award**  
    Must include reasons unless the parties agreed otherwise (e.g., consent awards).
    
- **Date and place (seat) of arbitration**  
    The award must specify the **seat**, which determines:  
    – Lex arbitri  
    – Annulment jurisdiction  
    – Nationality of the award (NYC Art. I).
    
- **Service/notification to parties**  
    Valid delivery to both parties is required to trigger time limits for annulment and enforcement.

### **What Formal Validity _is_**

- A procedural compliance standard.
    
- A precondition for both **enforceability** and **finality**.
    
- A mechanism ensuring the award meets **mandatory requirements** of the seat state and the New York Convention.

### **What Formal Validity _is not_**

- Not a review of the merits.
    
- Not about substantive correctness of the decision.
    
- Not the same as **substantive validity** (e.g., arbitrability, public policy, excess of mandate).

### **Links to Enforcement (NYC)**

A formally defective award risks refusal of enforcement under several NYC grounds, e.g.:

- **Art. V(1)(d)** – improper procedure or tribunal composition.
    
- **Art. V(1)(e)** – award not “binding” or properly issued under the lex arbitri.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Formal validity ensures the award **exists as a legally recognisable instrument**. Without it, the award cannot survive annulment review or circulate under the New York Convention.
