**Besix, Case C-256/00**

  

The Court interpreted **Brussels Convention, art. 5(1)** (now **Brussels I, art. 7(1)(a)**) concerning **multiple contractual obligations**.

  

**Facts:**

- **Besix**, a Belgian construction company, was involved in a joint venture for a construction project in Egypt.
    
- Dispute arose over payment and performance obligations under a **complex, multi-party contract**.
    
- Question: How to determine the **place of performance** when several obligations exist.
    

  

**Holding:**

- When a contract contains **several distinct obligations**, jurisdiction is not automatically at the place of one chosen obligation.
    
- The **“place of performance”** must be determined **separately for each obligation** in dispute.
    
- If no clear main obligation can be identified, the general rule applies: jurisdiction lies at the **defendant’s domicile** under **art. 4**.
    

  

**Significance:**

- Prevents forum shopping in multi-faceted contracts.
    
- Reinforces **predictability** by tying jurisdiction to the specific obligation being litigated.
    
- This case set limits to broad interpretations of contractual jurisdiction under the Brussels system.
