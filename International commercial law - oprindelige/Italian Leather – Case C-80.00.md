Italian Leather, Case C-80/00

### **Italian Leather, Case C-80/00**

  

**Facts**

- **Two parallel proceedings** involving the same parties and the same claim:
    
    - Italian court issued a judgment first.
        
    - German court later issued a judgment on the same matter.
        
    
- Issue arose when a party sought recognition and enforcement of the Italian judgment in Germany under the Brussels Convention.
    
- The question was whether the **later German judgment** could prevent recognition of the **earlier Italian judgment**.

**Legal Question**

- Under **Art. 27(3) Brussels Convention** (now **Art. 45.1.c Brussels I Recast**), can a Member State refuse recognition of a judgment from another Member State if there is a **conflicting judgment** between the same parties rendered in the state where enforcement is sought?
    

---

**Holding (ECJ)**

- **Yes.**
    
- The enforcing state may **give priority to its own judgment**, even if it was rendered **after** the foreign judgment.
    
- The purpose is to **protect the authority of the courts** in the enforcing state and prevent contradictory enforceable outcomes.
    
- The rule is **formal and automatic**, no review of correctness or timing.

**Key Legal Principle**

- **Art. 45.1.c Brussels I Recast**:
    
    - Recognition can be refused if there is an **irreconcilable judgment between the same parties** in the Member State where recognition is sought.
        
    - **Priority is always given to the domestic judgment**, regardless of which came first.
        
    
- Distinction from **Art. 45.1.d**:
    
    - _1.c_: Conflict with **domestic judgment** → domestic judgment prevails.
        
    - _1.d_: Conflict with judgment from **another Member State or third country** → priority to the **judgment rendered first**.

**Significance**

- Confirms that Brussels I protects the integrity of domestic court decisions.
    
- Even if the later domestic judgment undermines the uniformity of EU recognition rules, it still prevails in the enforcing state.
    
- Creates potential tension with **lis pendens rules** (Arts. 29-30), but ECJ treated Art. 45.1.c as **independent and decisive**.
