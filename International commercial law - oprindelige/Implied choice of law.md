### **Implied Choice of Law (Rome I – Art. 3(1))**

**Definition**  
Implied choice of law occurs when the parties **have not expressly chosen** the governing law, but their **intent to choose a particular law is clearly demonstrated** by the terms of the contract or the circumstances of the case.  
It is a **valid choice of law** under Rome I, provided the intention is **clear and certain**.

---

## **Legal Basis**

- **Rome I, Art. 3(1)**:  
    “The choice shall be made expressly **or clearly demonstrated by the terms of the contract or the circumstances of the case**.”
    

Implied choice = **choice without express wording**, but with **clear, objective indicators of intention**.

## **Indicators of Implied Choice**

Courts look for **strong, unambiguous links** showing that the parties intended a specific law:

### **1. Jurisdiction clause indicating a specific legal system**

- Exclusive jurisdiction of English courts → strong indicator of **English law**.
    
- Arbitration clause with explicit reference to a national law in procedural context.
    

### **2. Use of legal terminology specific to one system**

- References to “consideration,” “best efforts,” “warranty disclaimers” → points to **common law systems**.
    

### **3. Standard forms from a specific legal culture**

- Use of GAFTA, FIDIC, or LMA documentation referencing typical governing laws.
    

### **4. Prior course of dealings**

- Parties consistently used Danish law in earlier contracts → implied choice of **Danish law**.
    

### **5. Choice of law for parts of the contract**

- If one clause expressly uses French law, the remainder may also be impliedly subject to **French law**.
    

### **6. Mandatory link to a legal environment**

- Contract requires compliance with German regulatory standards → may indicate implied preference for **German law**.

## **What Implied Choice of Law _is_**

- A **valid choice** under Art. 3 Rome I.
    
- A form of **party autonomy**, inferred from objective evidence.
    
- A tool allowing courts to respect parties’ intentions even when they fail to draft an explicit clause.
    
- A mechanism that **overrides default rules** in Art. 4.

## **What It _is not_**

- Not the same as **characteristic performance** (used only when no choice exists).
    
- Not assumed lightly—courts require **clear and certain** indicators.
    
- Not inferred merely because the contract has a connection to a country.
    
- Not applicable based on convenience or fairness; it is **intent-based**, not policy-based.
    

---

## **Examples**

- Contract provides English jurisdiction, uses English boilerplate terms, and is drafted by English solicitors → implied choice of **English law**.
    
- Distribution agreement uses Danish statutory references and incorporates Danish industry standards → implied **Danish law**.
    
- Parties designate arbitration in Stockholm but all documents, obligations, and prior contracts rely on Norwegian law → implied choice of **Norwegian law**.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Implied choice of law recognises **party autonomy** even without an explicit clause. When contract structure and surrounding circumstances clearly indicate a selected legal system, Rome I treats that law as the **chosen lex contractus**, displacing all default connecting-factor rules.
