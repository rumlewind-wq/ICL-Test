### **Common Non-Arbitrable Areas (objective arbitrability limits)**

Non-arbitrable areas are **subject-matter categories** that cannot be resolved by arbitration because they involve **public regulatory authority**, **status rights**, or **third-party effects**. These domains require **exclusive state adjudication**.

---

## **Core Non-Arbitrable Categories**

### **1. Criminal Law & Penal Sanctions**

- Criminal liability
    
- Fines, penalties, punishment  
    **Reason:** exclusive state enforcement power; cannot be delegated.
    

### **2. Family & Personal Status Matters**

- Marriage, divorce, adoption
    
- Child custody, parental rights
    
- Succession disputes involving status  
    **Reason:** public interest + non-disposable personal status rights.
    

### **3. Insolvency / Bankruptcy (collective effects)**

- Opening of insolvency proceedings
    
- Ranking and admission of claims
    
- Avoidance actions with erga omnes effects  
    **Reason:** collective nature + court-supervised procedures.
    

### **4. Patent Validity (erga omnes effects)**

- Revocation or invalidation of patents
    
- Changes to patent registers  
    **Reason:** patents are **state-granted monopolies**; validity impacts the market and third parties.
    

### **5. Antitrust / Competition Fines**

- Imposition of regulatory or administrative fines
    
- Public enforcement of competition law  
    **Reason:** punitive and regulatory public authority.
    

### **6. Administrative & Public Law Decisions**

- Licences, permits, authorisations
    
- Tax assessments
    
- Customs decisions  
    **Reason:** cannot override or replace state regulatory acts.
    

### **7. Securities Regulation & Corporate Public-Law Matters**

- Public issuance approvals
    
- Regulatory sanctions by financial authorities  
    **Reason:** market supervision + third-party investor protection.
    

### **8. Labour Law (in some jurisdictions)**

- Certain employment rights (e.g., collective labour rights, statutory protections)  
    **Reason:** protective public policy; varies by jurisdiction.
    

### **9. Consumer Disputes (sometimes restricted)**

- Consumers may have **statutory prohibitions or limitations** on arbitration clauses.  
    **Reason:** mandatory protective rules.

## **What Non-Arbitrable Areas _are_**

- **Statutory subject-matter exclusions** from arbitration.
    
- Categories involving **public interest**, **state prerogatives**, or **erga omnes** effects.
    
- Boundaries enforced at:  
    – the **seat** (lex arbitri), and  
    – the **enforcement stage** (NYC Art. V(2)(a)).

## **What They _are not_**

- Not simply “complex” disputes—arbitration covers very complex commercial matters.
    
- Not excluded merely because public law is involved (e.g., competition damages claims **are arbitrable**).
    
- Not uniform—arbitrability varies by State; some jurisdictions allow broader arbitration.

## **Examples**

- Tribunal cannot revoke a patent → must be done by patent office or specialised court.
    
- Tribunal cannot issue a divorce decree.
    
- Tribunal cannot open insolvency or place a company into liquidation.
    
- Tribunal cannot impose antitrust fines, but **can** resolve antitrust damages claims.
    
- Tribunal cannot annul a regulatory licence but **can** adjudicate contractual disputes related to it.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Common non-arbitrable areas reflect **public-law domains** where arbitration cannot replace the authority of the State. Arbitrability is assessed under both the **seat’s law** and the **enforcement jurisdiction**, functioning as a mandatory boundary for private dispute resolution.
