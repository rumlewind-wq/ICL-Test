Capacity (legal ability of a person to enter into a contract) is **not regulated** by the Rome Convention or Rome I. Both instruments **exclude capacity** from their scope. As a result, the applicable law on capacity is determined by each forum’s **domestic private international law rules**.

**Operational meaning**

- Courts apply their **own conflict-of-laws system** to identify the law governing a party’s capacity.
    
- Common approaches:  
    – **Lex patriae** (nationality)  
    – **Lex domicilii** (domicile or habitual residence)  
    – Hybrid models used in some jurisdictions
    
- Capacity must be assessed **separately** from the contractual governing law (_lex contractus_).
    

**What this concept _is_**

- Recognition that capacity falls **outside harmonised EU choice-of-law rules** for contracts.
    
- A reversion to **forum-based PIL** to determine whether a party had the legal ability to contract.
    

**What it _is not_**

- Not determined by Rome I Art. 3 (party autonomy).
    
- Not governed by characteristic performance or any Art. 4 mechanisms.
    
- Not influenced by the contract’s governing law unless domestic PIL directs so.
    

**Practical impact**  
A party may be **incapable** under the law designated by the forum’s conflict rules even if the contract is valid under the _lex contractus_. This creates **dual-layer validity testing** in cross-border contracting.
