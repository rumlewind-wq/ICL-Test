### **Reverse Lis Pendens (general definition – Brussels Ia)**

**Reverse lis pendens** describes the situation where a **second-seized court** (normally required to stay its proceedings) is instead granted **priority** over the **first-seized court**, because of a **valid exclusive choice-of-court agreement** under **Brussels Ia Art. 25**.

It is the **opposite of the standard lis pendens rule**.

## **Standard Rule (Lis Pendens – Art. 29)**

- First-seized court proceeds.
    
- Second-seized court must stay and then decline jurisdiction.
    

---

## **Reverse Lis Pendens Mechanism (Art. 31(2) Brussels Ia)**

When parties have a **valid exclusive jurisdiction agreement**, Brussels Ia **reverses** the usual priority:

1. **The court designated in the choice-of-court agreement**  
    → **May proceed immediately**, even if seized _second_.
    
2. **Any non-chosen court seized first**  
    → Must **stay** its proceedings until the chosen court decides on jurisdiction.
    
3. If the chosen court accepts jurisdiction  
    → The first-seized (non-chosen) court must **decline jurisdiction**.
    

This eliminates “Italian torpedo” tactics—deliberate first-seizure in an undesired forum to block the chosen court.

## **What Reverse Lis Pendens _is_**

- A **priority rule favoring the chosen court**.
    
- A corrective mechanism ensuring **effectiveness of exclusive choice-of-court agreements**.
    
- An override of the chronological first-seized rule.
    
- A defensive measure against **torpedo actions**.
    

---

## **What It _is not_**

- Not applicable without an **exclusive** jurisdiction clause.
    
- Not relevant to **non-exclusive** or **asymmetric** clauses (unless clearly exclusive for the protected party).
    
- Not a form of anti-suit injunction (forbidden in the EU).
    
- Not available outside Brussels Ia.
    

---

## **Practical Example**

- Contract contains: “Exclusive jurisdiction: Paris Commercial Court.”
    
- Party A sues in **Italy** first (tactical torpedo).
    
- Party B sues in **Paris** second.
    

→ Under **Art. 31(2)**:

- Paris court (chosen) proceeds immediately.
    
- Italian court (first-seized) must stay and later decline jurisdiction.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Reverse lis pendens ensures that **exclusive choice-of-court agreements prevail** over first-seizure tactics. It empowers the **chosen court** to act as the primary forum, neutralising procedural abuse and restoring contractual certainty in cross-border litigation under Brussels Ia.
