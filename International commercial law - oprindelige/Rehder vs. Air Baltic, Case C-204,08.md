---
**Rehder v Air Baltic, Case C-204/08**

  

The Court interpreted **Brussels I, art. 7(1)(b)** (contract jurisdiction) for **air transport contracts**.

  

**Facts:**

- Passenger booked a flight from Munich (Germany) to Vilnius (Lithuania) with **Air Baltic**, an airline established in Latvia (then a third state under Brussels I).
    
- Flight was canceled. Passenger sued for compensation under **Regulation 261/2004**.
    
- Question: Which court has jurisdiction – departure location or arrival location?
    

  

**Holding:**

- For air transport of passengers, the **place of performance** is **both**:
    
    1. **Place of departure**, and
        
    2. **Place of arrival**,
        
        as agreed in the contract.
        
    
- The claimant may choose either of these courts to sue for full compensation.
    

  

**Significance:**

- Established clear and uniform jurisdiction rule for air travel disputes under Brussels I.
    
- Ensured predictability and procedural proximity for passengers and airlines.
    
- No reliance on national law or Montreal Convention for determining jurisdiction.
