Leathertex, Case C-420/97

**Leathertex, Case C-420/97**

  

The Court interpreted **Brussels Convention, art. 5(1)** (now **Brussels I, art. 7(1)(a)**) concerning **complex contracts with multiple obligations**.

  

**Facts:**

- **Leathertex**, an Italian company, was involved in a distribution contract for leather goods across several Member States.
    
- Dispute arose over different contractual obligations performed in different countries.
    
- Question: Could one Member State court have jurisdiction over the entire dispute?
    

  

**Holding:**

- If a contract has **several obligations** performed in different Member States, jurisdiction is only with the court for the **obligation in dispute**.
    
- There is **no general jurisdiction** in the place of the party’s main operations unless it is **explicitly agreed** by the parties.
    
- Reinforced the **principle of proximity** and **predictability**.
    

  

**Significance:**

- Limited broad readings of contract jurisdiction to prevent forum shopping.
    
- Confirmed that before Brussels I added specific rules in art. 7(1)(b), courts had to determine jurisdiction obligation by obligation.
    
- Prepared the ground for later reforms introducing uniform rules for **sale of goods** and **services**.
