### **Indirect Jurisdiction Test (general definition – recognition/enforcement stage)**

The **indirect jurisdiction test** is the rule that, when a court is asked to **recognise or enforce** a foreign judgment, it may **examine whether the foreign court had jurisdiction** — but **only indirectly**, meaning:

- **Not according to its own jurisdiction rules**, and
    
- **Only within the narrow grounds permitted by the applicable enforcement regime**.
    

It is a **recognition-stage control test**, not a primary jurisdiction test.

## **Core Meaning**

A court **does not review** whether the foreign court _should_ have exercised jurisdiction under its own national rules.  
Instead, it checks jurisdiction **only as allowed by the relevant instrument**, such as:

- **Brussels Ia** → _no_ indirect jurisdiction test (Member States must trust each other).
    
- **Hague Judgments Convention (2019)** → _yes_; recognises foreign judgments **only** if the originating court’s jurisdiction fits an **approved list**.
    
- **Bilateral treaties** → often include indirect jurisdiction control.
    
- **National PIL systems** → may refuse foreign judgments if the original court lacked “international jurisdiction” under local standards.
    

Indirect jurisdiction = **jurisdiction control at the enforcement stage**.

## **What the Indirect Jurisdiction Test _is_**

- A **limited review** of the foreign court’s competence when enforcing a judgment.
    
- A mechanism ensuring foreign courts do not overreach.
    
- A filter applied **only at the recognition/enforcement phase**, not during the foreign proceedings.
    
- A way to protect defendants from judgments rendered by courts with **excessively weak or exorbitant jurisdiction claims**.
    

---

## **What It _is not_**

- Not a **full jurisdiction review**.
    
- Not a merits review.
    
- Not permitted under **Brussels Ia** (EU prohibits jurisdiction review for Member State judgments).
    
- Not tied to domestic jurisdiction rules—the enforcing court **cannot** apply its own primary jurisdiction criteria.
    
- Not applicable to arbitral awards (NYC Art. V contains only consent- and agreement-based checks).

## **When the Test Is Applied**

### **1. Hague Judgments Convention (2019)**

Judgments are recognised **only if** the originating court’s jurisdiction fits a **closed list** (e.g., defendant’s habitual residence, branch, contractual place of performance, choice of court, etc.).  
→ This is the clearest modern example of an indirect jurisdiction test.

### **2. Non-EU national PIL systems**

Common in:

- U.S.
    
- Canada
    
- Australia
    
- Switzerland
    
- Many Latin American systems
    

Courts may refuse enforcement if the foreign court lacked a **reasonable jurisdictional basis**.

### **3. Older bilateral treaties**

Many contain explicit “indirect jurisdiction” clauses.

---

## **Examples**

- A U.S. court enforces a German judgment but first checks that the German court had **personal jurisdiction** under due-process standards → indirect jurisdiction review.
    
- A Canadian court refuses a Russian judgment because the defendant had **no meaningful connection** to Russia.
    
- Under the Hague 2019 Convention, a judgment is refused because the original court relied on **forum non conveniens–style jurisdiction**, which is **not** included in the closed list.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

The indirect jurisdiction test is a **recognition-stage filter** that checks whether the foreign court had a **permissible jurisdictional basis**, but **without applying domestic jurisdiction rules**. It is **forbidden within the EU**, but widely used in global PIL systems and embedded in modern conventions such as the **Hague Judgments Convention (2019)**.
