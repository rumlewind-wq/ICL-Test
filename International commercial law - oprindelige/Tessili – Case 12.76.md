Tessili, Case 12/76

**Tessili, Case 12/76**

  

The Court interpreted **Brussels Convention, art. 5(1)** (now **Brussels I, art. 7(1)(a)**) on how to determine the **place of performance** when it is not specified in the contract.

  

**Facts:**

- Italian company **Tessili** supplied textiles to a German company.
    
- The contract did **not specify** where payment should be made.
    
- Question: Which law decides the place of performance for jurisdictional purposes?
    

  

**Holding:**

- The **place of performance** must be determined **according to the law governing the contract** under **national private international law** rules of the court seised.
    
- This means the court must first identify the **applicable substantive law**, then apply that law to locate the relevant place of performance.
    

  

**Significance:**

- Introduced a **two-step process**:
    
    1. Identify applicable law via conflict-of-laws rules.
        
    2. Determine place of performance under that law.
        
    
- Created **legal complexity and unpredictability**, leading to later reform in **Brussels I, art. 7(1)(b)** with specific rules for sales of goods and services.
