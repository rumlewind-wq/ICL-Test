### **Ultra Petita – Model Law Art. 34(2)(a)(iii)**

**Definition**  
_Ultra petita_ refers to a situation where an arbitral tribunal **decides issues that were not submitted to it** by the parties.  
Under **Model Law Art. 34(2)(a)(iii)**, an award may be **set aside** if it:

- **Contains decisions beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration**, or
    
- **Grants relief not requested**, or
    
- **Resolves claims never referred to the tribunal**.
    

It is a **jurisdictional excess** problem, not a merits issue.

---

## **Core Meaning**

A tribunal acts _ultra petita_ when it:

- Awards a remedy never claimed
    
- Decides a legal question the parties did not submit
    
- Rules on matters outside the arbitration agreement
    
- Imposes obligations exceeding party submissions
    
- Resolves disputes involving third parties not subject to the arbitration
    

The tribunal must **stay within the four corners of the parties’ submissions**.

---

## **Model Law Basis**

**Art. 34(2)(a)(iii):**  
Award may be set aside if it _“deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission.”_

Courts may **sever** the ultra petita part and enforce the remainder if separable.

## **What Ultra Petita _is_**

- A **scope-of-mandate violation**.
    
- A tribunal deciding **more than the parties asked it to decide**.
    
- A jurisdictional overreach (excess of authority).
    
- A ground for both **annulment** (Art. 34) and **refusal of enforcement** (NYC Art. V(1)(c)).
    

---

## **What It _is not_**

- Not an error of law or fact.
    
- Not a merits review.
    
- Not triggered when tribunal selects a different legal reasoning **within the issues submitted**.
    
- Not applicable when the issue was fairly included in the parties’ pleadings.
    

---

## **Examples**

- Claimant requests damages only; tribunal also awards **specific performance** → ultra petita.
    
- Parties submit a pricing dispute; tribunal also decides **contract validity** (without pleadings) → ultra petita.
    
- Tribunal awards **more damages than requested**.
    
- Tribunal decides a claim belonging to a **non-signatory third party**.
    
- Arbor clause covers Contract A; tribunal also adjudicates **Contract B**.
    

---

## **Partial Annulment Possibility**

Courts often **sever** ultra petita findings:

- Valid parts remain enforceable
    
- Excess parts are annulled  
    (consistent with separability of award content)

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Ultra petita under Art. 34(2)(a)(iii) occurs when a tribunal **oversteps its mandate** by deciding issues **not submitted** to arbitration. It is a **jurisdictional defect and annulment ground**, distinct from merits review, and may lead to **partial or full annulment** depending on the scope of the excess.
