### **Choice of Law Circles (general definition – Rome I / Rome II methodology)**

**Choice of law circles** refer to the **structured, hierarchical layers** used to determine the applicable law in cross-border cases.  
Courts move through **concentric circles of analysis**, starting with **party autonomy**, then **default connecting factors**, and finally **escape mechanisms**.  
Each circle represents a **tier** of the choice-of-law system.

It is a _methodology framework_, not a statutory term.

## **The Three Classic Choice-of-Law Circles**

### **1. First Circle — Party Autonomy (Art. 3 Rome I)**

The **inner circle**.  
Parties may choose the law governing their contract.  
This choice overrides all default rules.

**Includes:**

- Express choice
    
- Implied choice (if clearly demonstrated)
    
- Partial or layered choices (different parts governed by different laws)
    

**If valid → analysis stops here.**

---

### **2. Second Circle — Default Objective Connecting Factors (Art. 4 Rome I)**

Applies **only if parties made no valid choice**.

Court determines the applicable law using:

- **Specific categories** (Art. 4(1)):  
    – Sale of goods → seller  
    – Services → service provider  
    – Distribution, franchise, etc.
    
- **Characteristic performance rule** (Art. 4(2))
    
- **Factual approximation** when multiple categories apply (Art. 4(4))
    

This circle identifies the **“most closely connected” law** using predefined connecting factors.

---

### **3. Third Circle — Escape Clause (Art. 4(3) Rome I)**

The **outer corrective circle**.

If the default rule points to a law that is **manifestly inappropriate**, the court may apply the law of another country with a **manifestly closer connection**.

This ensures **material accuracy** when the default rule misfires.

---

## **Additional Structures (for completeness)**

### **Pre-contractual liability (Rome II, Art. 12)**

Uses a parallel circle structure but governed under Rome II (tort).  
Choice of law circles still apply:

1. Agreement
    
2. Default rule (habitual residence of parties with closest link)
    
3. Escape clause
    

### **Overriding Mandatory Provisions (Art. 9 Rome I)**

Sit _outside_ the circles.  
Mandatory rules of the forum (and sometimes of the place of performance) may override chosen or default law.

### **Public Policy (ordre public)**

Final corrective boundary restricting application of foreign law.

---

## **What Choice-of-Law Circles _are_**

- A **tiered decision-making framework** for determining applicable law.
    
- A **methodological map** of Rome I/Rome II reasoning.
    
- A model explaining how courts move from **party autonomy → default rules → correction mechanisms**.
    

---

## **What They _are not_**

- Not a statutory term found in Rome I.
    
- Not a merits or fairness analysis.
    
- Not an alternative to connecting factors—circles _structure_ their use.
    
- Not a tool to impose lex mercatoria (Rome I requires choosing the “law of a country”).

## **Illustrative Example**

Contract with no governing-law clause:

1. **Circle 1**: No valid choice → move on.
    
2. **Circle 2**: Default rule → service provider in Sweden → Swedish law.
    
3. **Circle 3**: But contract is part of a broader transaction centred entirely in Denmark → manifestly closer connection → Danish law applies.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Choice-of-law circles provide a **hierarchical analytical model** for Rome I and II:

1. **Party choice**,
    
2. **Default connecting factors**,
    
3. **Escape clause**.  
    They ensure predictable, structured, and accurate identification of the applicable law in international commercial disputes.
