Bloos, Case 14/76



---

**Bloos, Case 14/76**

  

The Court interpreted **Brussels Convention, art. 5(1)** (now **Brussels I, art. 7(1)(a)**) concerning the **place of performance** in contractual disputes.

  

**Facts:**

- A Belgian employee (Bloos) sued his employer for unpaid severance compensation.
    
- The issue was whether the relevant place of performance should be linked to the **contract as a whole** or to the **specific obligation in dispute**.
    

  

**Holding:**

- The “**obligation in question**” under art. 5(1) refers **only to the contractual obligation forming the basis of the legal action**.
    
- Jurisdiction is therefore determined by **where that specific obligation was or should have been performed**,
    
    not where other, unrelated contractual obligations were carried out.
    

  

**Significance:**

- Narrowed jurisdiction to the **disputed obligation**, preventing overly broad forum choices.
    
- Established a core principle later applied in **Custom Made**, **Leathertex**, and **Besix**.
    
- Strengthened **predictability and proximity** in determining contractual jurisdiction.
