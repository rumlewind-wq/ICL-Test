### **Reciprocity Reservation – New York Convention Art. I(3)**

**Definition**  
The **reciprocity reservation** under **New York Convention Art. I(3)** allows a State to declare that it will apply the Convention **only to arbitral awards made in the territory of another Contracting State**.  
It is an **opt-in territorial limitation** based on **mutual enforcement commitments**.

It narrows the scope of the NYC’s application.

---

## **Core Meaning**

A State making this reservation enforces:

- **Awards from NYC Contracting States** → _Convention applies_
    
- **Awards from non-signatory States** → _Convention does not apply_; enforcement falls back on **domestic law**
    

The reservation is **optional** and made at the time of accession or ratification.

---

## **What the Reciprocity Reservation _is_**

- A **territorial enforcement filter**.
    
- A mechanism ensuring the State applies the NYC **mutually** with other signatories.
    
- A declaration that links enforceability to the **status of the seat** of arbitration.
    
- A valid way to limit the Convention’s reach without breaching the treaty.
    

---

## **What It _is not_**

- Not a restriction on enforcing _domestic_ awards.
    
- Not a merits or procedural defence.
    
- Not a permission to deny enforcement of awards from Contracting States.
    
- Not a subject-matter limitation (that is the **commercial reservation**).
    
- Not a review of the arbitration agreement itself.
    

---

## **Operational Effects**

If **Country A** declares the reciprocity reservation:

- Award from **Country B (NYC member)** → enforced under the NYC
    
- Award from **Country C (non-member)** → enforced under **Country A’s domestic arbitration law**, not the NYC
    
- Enforcement standards may be **less favourable** under domestic law
    

---

## **Examples**

- **United States**, **China**, **India**, and many others declared the reservation.  
    → They enforce only awards from NYC Contracting States under the Convention.
    
- If a Danish party obtains an award in **Singapore** (NYC State), it is enforceable in the U.S. under the NYC.
    
- If the same award were rendered in **Ethiopia** (non-Contracting State), U.S. courts enforce (if at all) under **state arbitration statutes**, not the NYC.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

The reciprocity reservation under Art. I(3) is a **territorial opt-in filter** allowing a State to apply the New York Convention **only to awards made in other Contracting States**. It preserves mutuality, limits enforcement exposure, and channels non-NYC awards into **domestic enforcement regimes**.
