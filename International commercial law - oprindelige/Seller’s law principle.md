### **Seller’s Law Principle (Rome I – pre-2008 / general PIL concept)**

**Definition**  
The _seller’s law principle_ is the traditional **default rule** in private international law that, in a contract for the **sale of goods**, the applicable law is the law of the **seller’s habitual residence**.  
It reflects the idea that the seller performs the **characteristic performance** of a sales contract.

It is the **precursor** to, and conceptually identical with, the **characteristic performance rule** in Rome I Art. 4(2).

## **Core Meaning**

In a **sales contract**:

- The **seller** supplies the defining, non-monetary performance (delivery of goods).
    
- The **buyer** only pays money (not “characteristic”).  
    → Therefore, the contract is most closely connected to the **seller’s law**.
    

This principle historically guided courts **before modern harmonisation** (Rome Convention, Rome I) and continues to influence interpretation.

## **Where It Appears in Modern Law**

### **1. Rome I – Art. 4(1)(a)**

Explicit rule:

- **Sale of goods → law of the seller’s habitual residence.**
    

### **2. Rome I – Art. 4(2)**

Where no specific rule applies, the characteristic performer’s habitual residence governs.  
→ For sales, this points again to the **seller**.

### **3. Arbitral and non-EU PIL**

The principle is still used as a **general connecting factor** in many jurisdictions and arbitral contexts.

## **What the Seller’s Law Principle _is_**

- A **default objective connecting factor** for sales contracts.
    
- A reflection of the **characteristic performance** methodology.
    
- A rule ensuring predictable, neutral law in international sales.
    
- A principle applicable **only if parties have not made a choice of law**.

## **What It _is not_**

- Not a mandatory rule—overridden by **party autonomy** (Rome I, Art. 3).
    
- Not applicable to **services contracts** (those follow the service provider’s law).
    
- Not a rule for determining **place of performance** (that is Art. 7(1)(b)).
    
- Not applicable if the **escape clause** (Art. 4(3)) points to a manifestly closer connection elsewhere.

## **Examples**

- A Swedish seller supplies goods to a Portuguese buyer without a choice-of-law clause.  
    → **Swedish law** applies.
    
- A German manufacturer sells machinery to a Danish distributor; no governing-law clause.  
    → **German law** applies.
    
- Contract for sale of raw materials between France and Poland; documents drafted around seller’s obligations.  
    → Seller’s habitual residence → **French law**.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

The seller’s law principle assigns the governing law of an international **sale of goods** contract to the **seller’s habitual residence**, reflecting the characteristic performance doctrine. Under Rome I, it is now expressly codified and sits at the centre of the **default choice-of-law architecture** for sales.
