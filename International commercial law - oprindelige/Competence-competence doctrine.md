**Competence-competence doctrine (general definition)**  
The competence-competence doctrine gives an **arbitral tribunal the authority to decide on its own jurisdiction**, including challenges to the existence, validity, or scope of the arbitration agreement.

It is a foundational principle of modern arbitration law.

### **Core Components**

- **Tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction**  
    Includes decisions on:  
    – Existence of the arbitration agreement  
    – Validity of the arbitration agreement  
    – Scope of the clause  
    – Arbitrability  
    – Whether claims fall within the submission to arbitration
    
- **Embedded in the UNCITRAL Model Law**  
    – **Model Law Art. 16(1)** explicitly recognises competence-competence.
    
- **Parallel court power preserved**  
    Courts at the seat retain **ultimate supervisory review**, particularly at:  
    – Annulment stage (Model Law Art. 34)  
    – Enforcement stage (NYC Art. V)

### **Positive vs. Negative Effect**

- **Positive effect**  
    Tribunal may **determine its own jurisdiction** as a matter of first instance.
    
- **Negative effect** (in some jurisdictions)  
    Courts must **defer** to the tribunal to decide jurisdiction first and must not pre-emptively rule on it.  
    – Strong in France.  
    – Weaker under Model Law (courts may still intervene early in some circumstances).

### **What the Doctrine _is_**

- A procedural autonomy rule for tribunals.
    
- A mechanism ensuring arbitration is not derailed by early court challenges.
    
- A principle supporting efficiency, party autonomy, and international enforceability.

### **What It _is not_**

- Not absolute—courts retain **final say**.
    
- Not a bar to judicial review.
    
- Not a merits decision; only jurisdictional.
    

---

### **Examples**

- Tribunal rules it has jurisdiction despite a challenge alleging invalidity of the arbitration clause.
    
- Tribunal issues a **[[Jurisdictional awards]]** affirming competence, subject to later seat-court review.
    
- A state court declines early jurisdictional review (negative effect) and refers the parties to arbitration.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Competence-competence ensures the tribunal is the **primary decision-maker** on jurisdiction, safeguarding procedural momentum while preserving court oversight only at the **annulment or enforcement** stages.
