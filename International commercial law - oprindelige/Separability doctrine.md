**Separability doctrine (general definition)**  
The separability doctrine means that the **arbitration agreement is legally independent from the underlying contract** in which it is contained. Even if the main contract is alleged to be invalid, void, voidable, terminated, or non-existent, the arbitration clause **survives** and remains capable of conferring jurisdiction on the arbitral tribunal.

It is a foundational doctrine for maintaining arbitral autonomy.

### **Core Effects**

- **Arbitration clause = separate agreement**  
    The clause is treated as a distinct contract embedded within the main contract.
    
- **Challenges to the main contract do not automatically invalidate the arbitration clause**  
    Claims of fraud, illegality, mistake, termination, or non-performance regarding the underlying contract **do not nullify** the arbitration agreement unless the clause itself is specifically impugned.
    
- **Tribunal retains authority to rule on jurisdiction**  
    Even where the main contract is challenged, the tribunal may decide whether the arbitration clause is valid—interlinking separability with the **[[Competence-competence doctrine]]**.
    
- **Preserves the efficiency of arbitration**  
    Prevents parties from defeating arbitration simply by alleging invalidity of the main contract.

### **What the Separability Doctrine _is_**

- A legal rule protecting the **autonomy** of the arbitration agreement.
    
- A mechanism ensuring disputes about contract validity are resolved **by the tribunal**, not courts.
    
- A doctrine embedded in:  
    – **Model Law Art. 16(1)**  
    – Major institutional rules (ICC, LCIA, SCC)  
    – New York Convention jurisprudence

### **What It _is not_**

- Not absolute—if the arbitration clause itself is specifically challenged (fraud, duress, non-consent), the doctrine **does not shield** it.
    
- Not a rule about substantive law; it is a rule about **jurisdictional autonomy**.
    
- Not dependent on the governing law of the main contract.

### **Examples**

- Party alleges the main contract is void for fraud.  
    → Arbitration clause survives; tribunal determines both fraud and contract validity.
    
- Party claims the main contract was never formed.  
    → Tribunal still has jurisdiction to decide whether a contract (including the clause) exists.
    
- Party argues the arbitration clause itself was signed under duress.  
    → Separability does **not** protect the clause; tribunal or court must examine this specific challenge.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

The separability doctrine protects arbitration from being derailed by attacks on the underlying contract. It ensures the arbitration agreement operates as a **self-standing jurisdictional commitment**, allowing the tribunal to proceed even when the validity of the main contract is in dispute.
