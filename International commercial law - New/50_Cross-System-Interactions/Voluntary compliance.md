### **Voluntary Compliance (general definition – enforcement of judgments/awards)**

**Voluntary compliance** refers to the situation where a party **complies with a judgment or arbitral award without coercive enforcement**. The debtor performs **voluntarily**, meaning courts or enforcement authorities do not need to intervene.

It is the **first and simplest enforcement path** in international commercial law.

## **Core Meaning**

A debtor:

- Pays the awarded amount
    
- Executes the required performance
    
- Stops prohibited conduct
    
- Delivers goods/services ordered  
    **without the creditor initiating formal enforcement (execution) proceedings.**
    

Most awards and judgments are satisfied this way.

## **Where It Matters (Arbitration + Litigation)**

- **International arbitration**  
    Many parties comply voluntarily because awards are final, confidential, and enforceable under the NYC.
    
- **Cross-border litigation**  
    Parties often comply before foreign enforcement is initiated, especially where the judgment is clearly enforceable under Brussels Ia or Hague instruments.
    
- **Settlement leverage**  
    Voluntary compliance often occurs after negotiations, payment plans, or commercially driven settlement adjustments.

## **What Voluntary Compliance _is_**

- A **non-coercive execution** of an award/judgment.
    
- A demonstration of **commercial willingness** to comply.
    
- A mechanism avoiding costs, delay, and risk of forced enforcement.
    
- The **ideal enforcement outcome** for creditors.

## **What It _is not_**

- Not a form of judicial enforcement.
    
- Not a waiver of rights—debtor simply chooses to comply.
    
- Not an admission of liability beyond the award/judgment.
    
- Not a guarantee for future compliance; only concerns the present decision.

## **Examples**

- A company receives an ICC award ordering payment of €3m and pays within 30 days without enforcement proceedings.
    
- A cross-border Brussels Ia judgment is complied with voluntarily once the debtor confirms it is enforceable in the EU.
    
- A debtor executes a settlement payment schedule after an award, avoiding forced execution.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Voluntary compliance is the **cleanest enforcement outcome**—the debtor performs without coercion, avoiding the cost and complexity of cross-border execution. It is driven by commercial incentives, enforceability pressure, and the credibility of awards and judgments.
