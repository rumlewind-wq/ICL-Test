### **Forced Compliance (general definition – enforcement of judgments/awards)**

**Forced compliance** refers to the **coercive execution** of a judgment or arbitral award through **state enforcement mechanisms**, after the debtor fails to comply voluntarily.  
It is the **second stage** of enforcement: the creditor activates the machinery of the courts or state authorities to compel performance.

## **Core Meaning**

The creditor uses **legal enforcement procedures** to:

- Seize assets
    
- Garnish bank accounts
    
- Register liens or charges
    
- Sell property (judicial sale)
    
- Enforce specific performance orders
    
- Impose penalties or contempt sanctions (where permitted)
    

The debtor’s cooperation is **not required**; enforcement is driven by state authority.

## **Sources of Authority**

- **Domestic enforcement law of the executing State**  
    → Execution always follows the **lex fori executionis**.
    
- **New York Convention** (for arbitral awards)  
    → Grants right to have a foreign award recognised, then enforced under national law.
    
- **Brussels Ia Regulation** (for EU judgments)  
    → Removes the exequatur stage; judgments circulate freely and are enforceable like local ones.
    
- **Hague Judgments Convention (2019)**  
    → For judgments of Contracting States outside the EU.

## **What Forced Compliance _is_**

- A **state-driven mechanism** compelling performance.
    
- The default route when voluntary compliance fails.
    
- A process defined entirely by the enforcement State’s procedural law.
    
- A powerful leverage tool in international debt recovery.

## **What It _is not_**

- Not an automatic right without prior recognition (foreign awards/judgments must first pass recognition or registration unless the instrument eliminates it).
    
- Not governed by the law of the seat (awards) or the law of origin (judgments).
    
- Not a merits review—enforcement courts do **not** reassess the correctness of the underlying decision.

## **Typical Examples**

### **Arbitral award (NYC)**

- Creditor obtains recognition in the enforcement State.
    
- Enforcement officer freezes debtor’s accounts.
    
- Court orders judicial sale of assets.
    

### **EU judgment (Brussels Ia)**

- Judgment from Germany is sent to Spain.
    
- Spanish enforcement authorities execute by garnishing wages or seizing property.
    

### **Non-EU judgment**

- Creditor seeks exequatur in the enforcement State.
    
- After recognition, domestic execution begins.

## **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Forced compliance is the **coercive enforcement stage** where the creditor leverages state power to execute judgments or arbitral awards. It operates entirely under the **procedural law of the enforcement State**, converting legal decisions into actual performance even when the debtor refuses to comply voluntarily.
