### **Reciprocity (general definition in international commercial law)**

**Reciprocity** is a legal principle under which a State or court extends a benefit—recognition, enforcement, or procedural privilege—**only if the other State provides the same treatment in return**. It creates a **mutual-obligation framework** ensuring symmetrical cross-border legal cooperation.

---

## **Core Functions**

- **Mutuality of treatment**  
    A State will enforce foreign judgments or arbitral awards **only if** the originating State offers equivalent enforcement rights.
    
- **Risk mitigation**  
    Ensures States do not unilaterally expose themselves to enforcement obligations without comparable protections.
    
- **Harmonisation tool**  
    Aligns cross-border enforcement by conditioning obligations on **reciprocal legal guarantees**.

## **Where Reciprocity Operates**

### **1. New York Convention (NYC) – Reciprocity Reservation**

Under **NYC Art. I(3)**, States may declare they will apply the Convention **only to awards made in other Contracting States**.  
→ Reciprocity as an **opt-in condition** for enforcement.

### **2. Recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments**

Some national systems (outside the EU framework) require **reciprocal recognition** before enforcing foreign judgments.

### **3. Bilateral treaties**

Reciprocity is often embedded in **bilateral enforcement agreements**, ensuring symmetrical obligations.

## **What Reciprocity _is_**

- A **conditional enforcement mechanism**.
    
- A tool for **structural equivalence** in international dispute resolution.
    
- A safeguard ensuring **balanced judicial cooperation**.
    
- A policy device to prevent unilateral exposure to foreign awards/judgments.
    

---

## **What It _is not_**

- Not an automatic bar to enforcement—courts must verify whether reciprocity is required and triggered.
    
- Not a merits test (it does not review the correctness of the foreign decision).
    
- Not relevant in **EU law**: Brussels Ia rejects reciprocity and instead mandates **automatic mutual recognition**.
    
- Not a choice-of-law principle.

## **Illustrative Examples**

- A State with an NYC reciprocity reservation enforces an award from Singapore (Contracting State) but **falls back to domestic law** for an award from a non-signatory country.
    
- A national court refuses to enforce a foreign judgment because the foreign State **does not recognise its own judgments**—reciprocity requirement unmet.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Reciprocity is a **mutual-commitment standard** used to structure cross-border enforcement risk. It conditions recognition and enforcement on the other State’s willingness to provide the **same procedural rights**, creating a balanced and predictable enforcement ecosystem.
