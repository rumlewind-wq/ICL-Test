# Which Instrument Applies?

Decision tree for matching disputes to the correct transnational instrument.

## Step 1 – Nature of proceeding
1. **Arbitration clause present?**
   - Yes → Prioritise [[Arbitration Agreement]], [[International Arbitration Hub]], [[New York Convention Art. V]].
   - No → Continue to Step 2.

2. **Court litigation within EU Member States?**
   - Yes → Apply [[EU Litigation Hub]] materials (Brussels Ia) for jurisdiction and recognition.
   - No → Consider Hague instruments or domestic PIL.

## Step 2 – Subject matter
- **Contractual obligations** → [[Choice of Law Hub]] (Rome I) and [[CISG Overview]] if sale of goods.
- **Non-contractual/tort** → [[Choice of Law for Non-Contractual Obligations (Rome II Regulation)]].
- **Purely commercial dispute with agreed court** → [[Global Litigation Instruments]] (Hague 2005) for exclusive choice-of-court agreements.

## Step 3 – Recognition/enforcement strategy
- **Judgments leaving EU** → Hague 2019 (if applicable) otherwise local exequatur.
- **Arbitral awards** → [[Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards (New York Convention)]].
- **Mixed structures** → Document in [[Double instrument]] note.

## Step 4 – Transactional overlays
- **Sales of goods** → align CISG + Incoterms with choice-of-law selection.
- **Investment-heavy contracts** → confirm arbitrability and mandatory rules in likely enforcement venues.
