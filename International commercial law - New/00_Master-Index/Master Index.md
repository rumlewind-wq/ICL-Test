# Master Index

Use this map to navigate the International Commercial Law vault. Each domain hub links to topic notes, case notes, and doctrine templates that support exam-ready recall.

## Domain hubs
- [[EU Litigation Hub]] – Brussels I/Ia jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement, ancillary EU procedures, and case law.
- [[Choice of Law Hub]] – Rome Convention/Rome I, Rome II, characteristic performance, escape clauses, and capacity rules.
- [[International Arbitration Hub]] – arbitration agreements, procedure, tribunal management, awards, annulment, and NYC enforcement.
- [[International Contracts and Transactions Hub]] – CISG, Incoterms, drafting/negotiation principles, and transactional doctrines.
- [[Cross-System Interactions Hub]] – instrument selection, Hague Conventions, coordination between Brussels–Rome–Hague–NYC, and public policy safeguards.

## Case law navigation
- EU cases live in [[EU Litigation Hub#CJEU case trackers]] with files under `/10_EU-Litigation/Cases`.
- Arbitration and global cases are catalogued under [[International Arbitration Hub#Case studies]] with files under `/30_International-Arbitration/Cases`.

## Study aids & governance
- Exam blueprints and meta notes: [[Eksamensdokument ICL]], [[Bestemmelseoversigt ICL]], [[ICL topics som slettes delvist når lavet]].
- Automation, metadata, and templates: see [[Repository Governance]] inside `/99_System`.

## Quick decisions
- Jump to [[Which Instrument Applies?]] for a decision-tree on whether to rely on Brussels Ia, Rome I/II, Hague 2005/2019, the New York Convention, or the CISG in a given scenario.
