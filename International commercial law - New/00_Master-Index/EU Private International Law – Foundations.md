# [[EU Private International Law – Foundations]]

## Direct EU framework (source: [[ICL emne fra bøger]])
- Direct effect of TFEU on Member State PIL
- Citizenship as a connecting factor
- Non-discrimination on grounds of nationality
- Free movement and origin-country control
- EU competence in civil justice harmonisation (Arts. 67–81 TFEU)
- Structural interaction between EU instruments: Brussels, Rome I, Rome II
- Institutional architecture: CJEU, Commission, Member States

## Systemic instruments (source: [[Bestemmelseoversigt ICL]])
- **[[Brussels I Recast Regulation (EU) 1215.2012]]** – current EU instrument governing jurisdiction plus recognition/enforcement
- **[[Lugano Convention 2007]]** – mirrors Brussels I (44/2001) for EU–EFTA disputes without the Recast reforms
- **[[Rome I Regulation 593/2008]]** and **[[Rome II Regulation 864/2007]]** – EU-wide choice-of-law regimes for contractual and non-contractual obligations
- **[[Hague Choice of Court Convention 2005]]** and **[[Hague Judgments Convention 2019]]** – global complements to the Brussels system

## Structural doctrines

### Forum non conveniens excluded (source: [[Forum non conveniens (EU rejection)]])
Forum non conveniens is a common-law doctrine allowing courts to decline jurisdiction if another forum is clearly more appropriate. **The EU rejects this doctrine entirely.** Courts subject to Brussels Ia **must exercise jurisdiction** when the Regulation confers it and have **no discretion** to decline on convenience, efficiency, or fairness grounds. The rule applies across all jurisdictional bases (general, special, exclusive, prorogation, appearance) and safeguards predictability plus mutual trust.

### Jurisdiction by appearance (source: [[Jurisdiction by appearance]])
Jurisdiction by appearance arises when a **defendant participates in proceedings without contesting jurisdiction**, thereby implicitly accepting the court’s authority (Brussels Ia Art. 26). The court must notify the defendant of its right to object; appearance solely to contest jurisdiction prevents prorogation. Protective regimes for consumers, insured parties, and employees cannot be bypassed using appearance.

### Lis pendens and reverse lis pendens (sources: [[Lis pendens]]; [[Reverse lis pendens]]; [[Italian torpedoes]])
- **Art. 29 lis pendens** prevents parallel proceedings: the court first seised determines jurisdiction while later-seised courts must stay proceedings and eventually decline jurisdiction once competence is confirmed. This avoids conflicting judgments but historically enabled **Italian torpedo** tactics where a party sues first in a slow forum to block the chosen court.
- **Reverse lis pendens (Art. 31(2) Brussels Ia)** corrects that abuse: when there is a valid exclusive choice-of-court clause, the chosen court may proceed immediately even if it was seised second, while any non-chosen court must stay and later decline jurisdiction. This secures the effectiveness of choice-of-court agreements.

### Parties and third states (source: [[Group Josi, Case C-412,98]])
The Brussels regime applies whenever the **defendant is domiciled in a Contracting State**, even if the claimant is not. The specialised insurance section does **not** extend to professional reinsurance contracts. This confirms the Regulation’s focus on defendant domicile and clarifies sectoral carve-outs.
