Here are concise, exam-ready answers to the lecture questions and case scenario:

---

### 1. Which judgments are entitled to recognition and enforcement under Brussels I?

- **All judgments from courts of EU Member States** in civil and commercial matters (Art. 36, 41 Brussels I Recast).
    
- Judgments from **non-Member States** fall outside Brussels I and are governed by **national law** or applicable conventions (e.g. Hague 2005/2019).
    

---

### 2. Prohibition against reviewing jurisdiction

- **Art. 45(3)**: The court addressed may not check whether the foreign court had jurisdiction.
    
- Exception: limited categories where review is expressly allowed (insurance, consumers, employees, exclusive jurisdiction, Art. 45(1)(e)).
    
- Purpose: uphold **mutual trust** and avoid relitigation of jurisdiction.

### 3. Prohibition against substantive review

- **Art. 52**: No review of the merits of the foreign judgment.
    
- The enforcing court cannot re-examine facts, evidence, or legal reasoning.
    
- Only procedural grounds in Art. 45 may justify refusal.

### 4. Public policy

- **Art. 45(1)(a)** ground for refusal.
    
- Examples: denial of fair trial, serious violation of fundamental rights, manifest breach of essential national principles.
    
- Case law:
    
    - **Krombach (C-7/98)** → manifest breach of fair trial rights.
        
    - **Renault (C-38/98)** → cannot use public policy as disguised merits review.
        
- Concept: public policy is **national**, but limited by EU interpretation → only manifest breaches qualify.

### 5. Conflicting judgments

- **Art. 45(1)(c)**: Refusal if judgment conflicts with an earlier judgment between same parties in the MS addressed.
    
- **Art. 45(1)(d)**: Refusal if judgment conflicts with an earlier judgment between same parties from another MS or a third state entitled to recognition.
    
- Priority to **earlier judgment** or to **domestic judgment**.

# Case 1

**Facts:** A (Germany) judgment vs. B (Spain). B (Spain) judgment vs. A (Germany). Same contract.

1. **A seeks recognition/enforcement in Spain**
    

- Spain is both the place of origin of B’s judgment and the place of enforcement for A’s.
    
- Under **Art. 45(1)(c)**, Spanish courts can refuse recognition of A’s German judgment because it conflicts with an existing Spanish judgment between the same parties.
    

2. **B seeks recognition/enforcement in Germany**
    

- German courts must recognise Spanish judgments under Brussels I.
    
- But **Art. 45(1)(c)** allows Germany to refuse if the Spanish judgment conflicts with the existing German judgment.
    
- Likely: German judgment takes priority.
    

3. **Both A and B seek recognition/enforcement in Luxembourg**
    

- Luxembourg court faced with two conflicting EU judgments.
    
- **Art. 45(1)(d)** applies: if two irreconcilable judgments exist, priority is given to the **judgment first rendered**.
    
- The second judgment may be refused recognition in Luxembourg.
