Lecture 4 focuses on **recognition and enforcement of judgments** under the Brussels I Regulation and the interaction with national law and global conventions. From the slides, syllabus, and related exam materials, the key takeaways go further than the bullet points:

1. **Basic concepts**
    
    - Distinction between _recognition_ (giving extraterritorial effect) and _enforcement_ (using state power, e.g. bailiff).
        
    - _[[Res judicata]]_: judgments prevent relitigation of the same matter, ensuring procedural economy.
        
2. **National systems**
    
    - Civil law states (Austria, Germany, Italy, Greece, France, Netherlands) rely on reciprocity, mirror rule, or earlier substantive review (révision au fond).
        
    - Common law states (England & Wales) apply unilateral recognition based on presence/residence or choice of court.
        
    - Important shift in France: Munzer (1964) rejected review on the merits, Avianca (2007) rejected choice-of-law control.
        
    - Example: punitive damages partially denied recognition in Germany (BGH 1992).
        
3. **EU system under Brussels I (Recast 2012)**
    
    - _[[Double instrument]]_: harmonized jurisdiction + recognition and enforcement.
        
    - Jurisdiction: parallel system (EU defendants under Brussels I; non-EU under national law).
        
    - Recognition: unified system, automatic across EU (Arts. 36, 39), no exequatur.
        
    - _Two prohibitions_: no review of substance (Art. 52), no review of foreign jurisdiction (Art. 45(3)), subject to exceptions (insurance, consumers, employees, exclusive jurisdiction).
        
    - Defences are exhaustively listed in Art. 45 (public policy, conflicting judgments, default of appearance, etc.).
        
4. **Defences and case law**
    
    - _Public policy_ (Art. 45(1)(a)): national but limited by EU interpretation. Key cases:
        
        - **Krombach (C-7/98)** [[Krombach – Case C-7.98]]: refusal only if manifest breach of fundamental principles.
            
        - **Renault (C-38/98)** [[Renault – Case C-38.98]]: no substantive review disguised as public policy.
            
    - _Conflicting judgments_:
        
        - Art. 45(1)(c): domestic judgment in requested state prevails (Italian Leather, C-80/00). [[Italian Leather – Case C-80.00]]
            
        - Art. 45(1)(d): earlier judgment from another MS or third state may take priority. 
            
    - _[[Due process]]_ exceptions: e.g. lack of proper service.
        
5. **Global conventions**
    
    - **Hague 2005 Choice of Court Convention**: double convention, but narrow in scope (only exclusive choice of court agreements).
        
    - **Hague 2019 Judgments Convention**: simple recognition convention, broader scope but not yet widely ratified.
        
    - These instruments aim to fill the gap for enforcement outside the EU.
        
6. **Underlying principle**
    
    - _Mutual trust_ among EU Member States justifies minimal grounds for refusal.
        
    - Compared with arbitration (New York Convention 1958, broader global coverage), judgment recognition is more fragmented globally.
        

So beyond the slides, the lecture teaches:

- Why the EU regime is exceptional (automatic recognition, limited defences).
    
- How national traditions and global conventions differ.
    
- How ECJ case law defines the narrow scope of public policy.
    
- How Brussels I Recast integrates recognition/enforcement with jurisdiction, ensuring predictability and efficiency.
    

Do you want me to expand this into a structured **exam-ready outline** (questions + rules + case law + application), so you can use it directly for preparation?

# Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments (Brussels I and beyond)

## 1. Concepts and distinction

- **Recognition** (Art. 36, 41): Automatic effect of judgments across EU; no special procedure.
    
- **Enforcement** (Art. 39): Execution of judgment; exequatur abolished in 2012 Recast.
    
- **Res judicata**: Judgment precludes relitigation; ensures procedural economy.
    
- **Voluntary vs. forced compliance**: Recognition is precondition to enforcement.
    

## 2. National law approaches (outside Brussels I)

- **Austria**: _No R+E unless a convention_.
    
- **Netherlands**: Reciprocity in Code of Civil Procedure, but case law open (acceptance of “internationally accepted standards of jurisdiction”).
    
- **Germany, Italy, Greece**: Mirror rule – recognition if foreign court had indirect jurisdiction.
    
- **England & Wales**: Common law – unilateral recognition on presence, residence, or choice of court.
    
- **France**:
    
    - Pre-1964: _révision au fond_ (substantive review).
        
    - **Munzer 1964**: merits review rejected, but choice-of-law control required.
        
    - **Avianca 2007**: choice-of-law control abandoned.
        
- **Public policy limits**: BGH 1992 – punitive damages partly refused (US judgment recognised only for compensatory part).
    

## 3. EU system under Brussels I (Recast 2012)

- **Double instrument**:
    
    - Jurisdiction rules + recognition/enforcement rules.
        
    - Based on _mutual trust_.
        
- **Jurisdictional reach**:
    
    - Defendants domiciled in EU → Brussels I rules.
        
    - Defendants domiciled outside EU → national law.
        
- **Recognition unified**: Brussels I applies to _all_ judgments from MS, regardless of jurisdictional basis.
    

### 3.1 Recognition and enforcement procedure

- **Art. 2(a)**: Definition of judgment (broad, includes orders, costs; excludes arbitration).
    
- **Art. 36 & 41**: Judgments automatically recognised; no special procedure needed.
    
- **Art. 39**: Judgments enforceable without exequatur; same effects as in state of origin.
    
- **Art. 42–44**: Technical requirements (certificate, copy of judgment).
    
- **Art. 46**: Enforcement in the same way as domestic judgments.
    
- **Art. 48–50**: Adaptation of remedies not known in local law (e.g. foreign damages categories).
    
- **Art. 47**: Provisional/protective measures enforceable if defendant summoned. _Denilauler_ (C-125/79): ex parte measures excluded. [[Denilauler – Case 125.79]]
    

### 3.2 Two prohibitions

- **Art. 52**: No review of substance.
    
- **Art. 45(3)**: No review of jurisdiction, except limited categories (insurance, consumers, employees, exclusive jurisdiction – Art. 45(1)(e)).
    

### 3.3 Defences (Art. 45, exhaustive list)

1. **Public policy (Art. 45(1)(a))**
    
    - Narrowly construed.
        
    - **Krombach (C-7/98)**: Only manifest breach of essential principle or fundamental right.
        
    - **Renault (C-38/98)**: No disguised substantive review.
        
2. **Default of appearance / due process (Art. 45(1)(b))**
    
    - Defendant must have been properly served.
        
3. **Conflicting judgment in MS addressed (Art. 45(1)(c))**
    
    - Domestic judgment prevails.
        
    - **Italian Leather (C-80/00)**.
        
4. **Conflicting judgment from another MS or third state (Art. 45(1)(d))**
    
    - Earlier judgment prevails if entitled to R+E.
        
5. **Exclusive jurisdiction/weak party cases (Art. 45(1)(e))**
    
    - Insurance, consumers, employment, or matters of exclusive jurisdiction (e.g. real estate).
        

## 4. Global system

- **Hague 2005 Choice of Court Convention**
    
    - Double convention (jurisdiction + R+E).
        
    - Limited to _exclusive_ choice of court agreements.
        
- **Hague 2019 Judgments Convention**: Simple recognition convention, broader scope, few ratifications.
    
- Comparison: Arbitration enjoys global enforcement via **New York Convention 1958**; judgment recognition remains fragmented.
    

## 5. Case law (exam-relevant)

- **Denilauler (125/79)** – ex parte interim measures excluded from automatic recognition.
    
- **Krombach (C-7/98)** – public policy, manifest breach test.
    
- **Renault (C-38/98)** – no substantive review.
    
- **Italian Leather (C-80/00)** – conflicting judgments, domestic priority.
    

## 6. Exam questions to anticipate

- Which judgments are entitled to recognition under Brussels I? (→ All MS judgments, Art. 36, 41).
    
- Meaning of prohibition against jurisdiction review? (→ Art. 45(3)).
    
- Meaning of prohibition against substantive review? (→ Art. 52).
    
- Give examples of public policy. Uniform or national? (→ National, but limited by ECJ case law).
    
- When can conflicting judgments bar recognition? (→ Arts. 45(1)(c)–(d)).
    
- What about protective measures? (→ Art. 47 + _Denilauler_).
    
- How are unfamiliar remedies handled? (→ Arts. 48–50 adaptation).
