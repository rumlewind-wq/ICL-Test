- The **Lugano system still matters** when dealing with **EFTA states** (CH, NO, IS).

### **[[Lugano Convention 2007]]**

All provisions are structurally identical to Brussels I (44/2001).  
Where a more modern equivalent exists in the **Brussels I Recast (1215/2012)**, this is explicitly shown.

## **Historical / Modern Mapping Notes**

The **Lugano Convention 2007** is technically **current**, but its **functional equivalent in EU law** is **historical**, because:

- It mirrors the **Brussels I Regulation (44/2001)**
    
- It does **not** incorporate the reforms of the **Brussels I Recast 1215/2012**  
    (e.g. abolition of exequatur, reverse lis pendens, expanded consumer protection)
    

Therefore, in situations involving **EU–EU litigation**, the correct modern reference is **Brussels I Recast (1215/2012)**.

Where appropriate:

- **art. 5(1) Lugano 2007 → art. 7(1) Brussels I Recast**
    
- **art. 5(3) Lugano 2007 → art. 7(2) Brussels I Recast**
    
- **art. 17 Lugano 2007 → art. 25 Brussels I Recast**
    
- **art. 21–23 Lugano 2007 → arts. 29–34 Brussels I Recast**
    
- **art. 31–34 Lugano 2007 → arts. 36–39 Brussels I Recast** (Recast removed exequatur)
    

These cross-references matter for exams when comparing:

- EU–EU litigation (Recast)
    
- EU–EFTA litigation (Lugano 2007)

- Used globally; important for understanding arbitration in jurisdictions adopting it.

### **[[UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (as revised 2010)]]**

**This law is in force.**  
It is **not superseded**, because it is an _ad hoc procedural framework_ for arbitral proceedings.

## **Summary for Exam Context**

The **UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules** serve as the global baseline for **ad hoc arbitration**, especially when:

- the arbitration clause says _“UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules apply”_, or
    
- parties want maximum procedural neutrality.
    

The **key exam-relevant articles** in your slides are:

- **art. 26** → Interim measures (tribunal level)
    
- **art. 34** → Awards (form, validity, partial awards)
    
- **art. 34(1)** → Partial/interim awards
    
- **art. 34(2)** → Finality
    
- **art. 34(4)** → Corrections
    
- **art. 33(1)** → Use of non-state law (lex mercatoria)
    

No provisions are historical or superseded.

### **[[UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce (1996)]]**

**This law is in force.**  
It is _not_ superseded, but it functions as a **soft-law framework** adopted into national legislation.  
In your lecture materials, it is referenced **only for its influence on other instruments**, not for operative rules in arbitration or ICL.

Your slides mention **only one article** from this Model Law.  
Below is the complete list of all provisions actually used in your course content.

---

## **[[UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce]] — Article Index (All Articles Used)**

- **art. 6 – Electronic form equivalence**  
    Functional equivalence rule allowing contracts and declarations to be formed electronically (email, fax, electronic communication).
    
    _(Used in your Hague Convention commentary: the formal requirements for choice-of-court agreements are inspired by ML Electronic Commerce art. 6.)_
    

---

## **Notes for Exam Context**

- Only **Article 6** appears in your materials.
    
- It is used **indirectly**, to explain that modern instruments (Hague 2005, Brussels I Recast art. 25) accept **electronic choice of court agreements**.
    
- The Model Law remains **valid**, but **has no direct operational role** in ICL or arbitration procedure in your syllabus.
    

### **[[CISG 1980 – United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods]]**

**This law is fully in force.**  
It is **not superseded**.  
It governs **international sales of goods** unless excluded by the parties (CISG art. 6).

Your lecture materials reference **only a limited set of CISG provisions**.  
Below is a **complete list of every CISG article actually used** in the course, formatted in exam-optimized style.

---

## **[[CISG 1980]] — Article Index (All Articles Used)**

- **art. 1 – Scope of application**  
    Governs international sales when parties are in different Contracting States or when private international law leads to the law of a Contracting State.
	- **art. 1(1)(a) – Contracting States criterion**  
	    Applies when both parties have their place of business in CISG States.
	- **art. 1(1)(b) – Private international law criterion**  
	    Applies when conflict-of-laws rules lead to the law of a CISG State.  
	    _(Historical relevance: Denmark, Norway, Sweden declared reservations; see art. 94)_
	    
- **art. 6 – Party autonomy / opt-out**  
    CISG applies unless excluded; parties may derogate or vary effect of any provision.
    
- **art. 94 – Nordic reservation**  
    Allows Nordic States (DK, NO, SE, FI, IS) to exclude CISG for intra-Nordic trade.
    

---

## **Historical / Outdated Notes**

- **CISG art. 1(1)(b)** was historically _not applied_ by several Nordic States due to declarations under **art. 94**, but the Convention itself is **not outdated**.
    
- All referenced provisions remain **current, valid, and applicable** today.
    

---

## **Exam Summary**

The course uses CISG only for jurisdictional/choice-of-law interaction examples:

- **art. 1(1)(a–b)** to illustrate factual vs. conflict-based applicability
- **art. 6** for party autonomy parallels with Rome I / arbitration agreements
- **art. 94** for Nordic reservations (important in Danish context)
