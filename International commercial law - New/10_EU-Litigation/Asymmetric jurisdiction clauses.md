### **Asymmetric Jurisdiction Clauses (general definition)**

Asymmetric jurisdiction clauses give **different jurisdictional rights to each party**. One party is bound to litigate in a specific court, while the other party retains **greater flexibility** to sue in multiple forums. They are common in **finance, banking, and high-leverage commercial contracts**.

They are also called **unilateral**, **one-way**, or **option** jurisdiction clauses.

### **Core Structure**

- **Party A (usually lender/financial institution):**  
    May sue **in any competent court** or in the chosen court.
    
- **Party B (usually borrower/debtor):**  
    Must sue **exclusively** in the chosen court.
    

This creates **asymmetry** in litigation options.

### **Operational Rationale**

- Used for **risk management**, **creditor protection**, and **enforcement flexibility**.
    
- Ensures predictable litigation when the debtor sues (must sue in designated court).
    
- Allows the creditor to pursue assets or enforcement where commercially optimal.

### **What Asymmetric Clauses _are_**

- Contractual mechanisms allocating **unequal jurisdictional rights**.
    
- A specialised form of **prorogation of jurisdiction**.
    
- Enforceable in many jurisdictions—especially under **Brussels Ia Art. 25**, if consent is clear.
    
- Widely used in cross-border lending and financial transactions.

### **What They _are not_**

- Not invalid per se (no principle of “jurisdictional equality”).
    
- Not arbitration clauses (they operate within court jurisdiction).
    
- Not uncertain or pathological if drafted precisely.
    
- Not enforceable everywhere—some legal systems are restrictive (notably France in consumer/adhesion contexts).

### **Validity Landscape**

- **Generally enforceable** in most EU Member States under **Brussels Ia Art. 25**, provided:  
    – Consent is clear  
    – Clause is drafted precisely  
    – Not used against protected categories (consumer/employee)
    
- **More restrictive jurisdictions**:  
    – France: historically scrutinised one-way clauses for lack of “predictability,” but modern case law is more permissive in B2B contracts.  
    – Some CIS and Latin American jurisdictions may treat them as unfair or contrary to procedural equality.

### **Examples**

- **Typical finance clause:**  
    “Borrower may bring proceedings only in the courts of London.  
    The Lender may bring proceedings in London or any other court of competent jurisdiction.”
    
- **Option clause in commercial distribution:**  
    “Distributor must sue in Paris courts. Supplier may sue in any court competent under applicable law.”

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Asymmetric jurisdiction clauses are **strategic litigation tools** that secure a **fixed forum** for weaker parties while giving the economically stronger party **broad enforcement mobility**. Valid in most major commercial jurisdictions when drafted cleanly and supported by clear consent.
