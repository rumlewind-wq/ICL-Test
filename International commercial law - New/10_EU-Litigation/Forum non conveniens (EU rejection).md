### **Forum Non Conveniens (EU Rejection)**

**Definition**  
Forum non conveniens is a **common-law doctrine** allowing courts to decline jurisdiction if another forum is **clearly more appropriate** for resolving the dispute.

**The EU rejects this doctrine entirely.**

---

### **EU Position**

- **Brussels Ia Regulation expressly excludes forum non conveniens.**  
    Courts **must** exercise jurisdiction when the Regulation confers it.
    
- No discretion to decline jurisdiction on convenience, efficiency, or fairness grounds.
    
- Applies across all bases of jurisdiction:  
    – General jurisdiction (domicile)  
    – Special jurisdiction (contract, tort)  
    – Exclusive jurisdiction  
    – Prorogation agreements  
    – Jurisdiction by appearance
    

This ensures **predictability, legal certainty, and uniformity** across Member States.

### **Core Consequences**

- **Mandatory jurisdiction:** EU courts cannot refuse jurisdiction because another country is “more suitable.”
    
- **No balancing test:** Factors such as witnesses, evidence, applicable law, cost, or convenience are irrelevant.
    
- **Strict rule-based system:** Jurisdiction is determined mechanically under Brussels Ia.
    
- **Strategic impact:**  
    – Eliminates forum-shopping through convenience arguments.  
    – Supports free movement of judgments within the EU.  
    – Forces litigation to remain within the Regulation’s system.

### **What EU Rejection _is_**

- A **complete prohibition** on applying forum non conveniens within the Brussels Ia framework.
    
- A cornerstone of EU civil-procedure harmonisation.
    
- A rule ensuring **automatic jurisdiction** when the Regulation points to a Member State.

### **What It _is not_**

- Not a partial limitation—there is **zero discretion**.
    
- Not dependent on the facts of the case.
    
- Not affected by practical obstacles (witnesses abroad, foreign law complexities).
    
- Not applicable even when non-EU courts are more connected to the dispute.

### **Illustrative Example**

- A Spanish defendant is sued in Germany (domicile-based jurisdiction).  
    Defendant argues the dispute is more connected to Brazil.  
    → German court **must** hear the case; forum non conveniens is prohibited.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Forum non conveniens is **incompatible** with the EU’s jurisdictional regime. Brussels Ia imposes **strict, non-discretionary jurisdiction**, preventing courts from declining jurisdiction on grounds of convenience or appropriateness, and thereby safeguarding predictability and free circulation of judgments.
