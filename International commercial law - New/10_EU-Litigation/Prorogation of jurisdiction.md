**Prorogation of jurisdiction (general definition)**  
Prorogation of jurisdiction refers to the **parties’ agreement to confer jurisdiction on a specific court** for disputes arising out of a contractual or non-contractual relationship. It is the **court-litigation analogue** to selecting an arbitral tribunal.

It is the mechanism by which parties **choose a court**, rather than accepting the default jurisdiction rules.

### **Core Components**

- **Party autonomy in litigation**  
    Parties designate **which court** will have jurisdiction (often exclusive).
    
- **Recognised under Brussels Ia**  
    – **Art. 25**: Parties may designate the courts of any Member State, regardless of domicile.  
    – Consent must be clear and consistent with formal validity requirements (writing or equivalent durable form).
    
- **Binding effect**  
    Once prorogated:  
    – The chosen court **must accept** jurisdiction.  
    – All non-chosen courts **must decline** jurisdiction.  
    – Lis pendens rules do **not** override the agreement (priority rule).

### **Types of Prorogation**

- **Exclusive prorogation**  
    One court has _sole_ jurisdiction → all others must decline.
    
- **Non-exclusive prorogation**  
    Parties allow litigation in the chosen court _and_ potentially elsewhere.
    
- **Asymmetric prorogation**  
    One party has more flexibility (e.g., bank may sue anywhere; debtor must sue in chosen court). Validity varies by jurisdiction.

### **What Prorogation of Jurisdiction _is_**

- Agreement-based transfer of adjudicative power to a chosen court.
    
- A binding jurisdiction-conferral mechanism in cross-border litigation.
    
- A tool to ensure **predictability, forum control, litigation risk management**.
    
- A key feature of commercial contracting in the EU and under the **2005 Hague Choice of Court Convention**.

### **What It _is not_**

- Not the same as arbitration.
    
- Not governed by Rome I (choice of law), but by procedural instruments (Brussels Ia, Hague 2005).
    
- Not valid if consent is defective (fraud, misrepresentation, incapacity, non-compliance with formal rules).
    
- Not a choice-of-law clause—prorogation selects **which court**, not **which law**.

### **Examples**

- “The parties agree that the **Commercial Court of London** shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute.”
    
- “The parties submit to the **non-exclusive jurisdiction** of the courts of Paris.”
    
- Finance agreement: Borrower must sue only in Luxembourg; lender may sue anywhere permitted by law (asymmetric clause).

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Prorogation of jurisdiction is the **contractual allocation of judicial authority**. It centralises litigation in a chosen court, ensuring jurisdictional certainty and reducing procedural risk across borders.
