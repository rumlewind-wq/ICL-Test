### **Mirror Rule (general definition – recognition of foreign judgments & arbitral awards)**

The **mirror rule** is the principle that the **recognising or enforcing court must give the foreign judgment or award exactly the same effect it has in the State of origin**, **no more and no less**.  
The recognising court must “**mirror**” the legal consequences of the original decision.

It is a **core principle of international judgment recognition**.

---

## **Core Meaning**

- The enforcing court treats the foreign judgment **as if it were a domestic judgment**,  
    but only **to the extent** that the judgment is effective in the State of origin.
    
- The enforcing court **copies** the scope, content, and limits of the foreign decision.  
    It cannot:  
    – Expand the relief  
    – Modify or revise the decision  
    – Add new remedies  
    – Reassess the merits  
    – Change interest rules unless enforcement law requires it
    

This ensures **uniformity** and **predictability**.

## **Practical Effects**

### **1. Same operative effect**

If the foreign judgment:

- is final → treated as final
    
- is only partially final → only that part is enforceable
    
- awards €1m → enforcing court cannot convert into another remedy
    
- orders injunction → enforcing court must enforce injunction if available under domestic law
    

### **2. No re-litigation**

The enforcing court cannot re-open:

- Facts
    
- Law
    
- Evidence
    
- Legal reasoning
    

→ Mirrors res judicata effect.

### **3. Limits of origin state are mirrored**

If the judgment is appealable in the origin State, its enforceability may be suspended (depending on the applicable regime).

## **What the Mirror Rule _is_**

- A **non-revision** principle.
    
- A requirement to replicate the **legal effect** of the decision from the origin jurisdiction.
    
- A mechanism to ensure **consistency** across borders.
    
- A key structural rule in systems like **Brussels Ia** and **Hague Judgments Convention**.

## **What It _is not_**

- Not a merits review.
    
- Not a transformation of the foreign judgment into a domestic decision.
    
- Not permission to correct, improve, or reinterpret the judgment.
    
- Not applicable if the foreign judgment violates **public policy** or **mandatory defences** (e.g., due process failure).

## **Examples**

- A German court awards **€500,000 + 5% interest**.  
    → The enforcing Spanish court must enforce **exactly** that amount and the same interest rules (unless Spanish public policy requires modification).
    
- A French judgment grants an injunction unavailable under local law.  
    → Many systems re-characterise the remedy, but the **operative effect** must still mirror the original as closely as domestic law allows.
    
- A U.S. judgment decides liability but leaves damages to a later proceeding.  
    → Only the liability part is recognised; damages cannot be enforced because they are **not yet final** in the State of origin.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

The mirror rule obliges the enforcing court to give a foreign judgment or arbitral award **the same effect** it has at the origin, without modification or merits review. It is a **foundational non-intrusion rule**, preserving the stability and predictability of cross-border enforcement.
