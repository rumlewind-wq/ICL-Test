### **Three-Step Test – Art. 7(1)(a) Brussels Ia (place of performance: contracts)**

**Definition**  
The three-step test under **Brussels Ia Art. 7(1)(a)** determines the **“place of performance of the obligation in question”** when assessing special jurisdiction in **matters relating to a contract**.  
It applies **only** when the contract does **not** fall under the special rules of Art. 7(1)(b) (sale of goods / provision of services).

It is a _jurisdiction-allocation test_, not a choice-of-law rule.

## **The Three Steps**

### **Step 1 — Identify the contractual obligation forming the basis of the claim**

- The court isolates the **specific obligation** the claimant relies upon (payment, delivery, performance).
    
- This is not every obligation in the contract—only the one the lawsuit is based on.
    
- Authority: **Tessili**, **De Bloos** jurisprudence.
    

### **Step 2 — Characterise the place of performance of that obligation under the applicable law**

- The court uses the **law governing the obligation** (lex contractus) to determine **where** it is legally to be performed.
    
- This requires interpretation under national contract law (Rome I in EU cases).
    
- Place of performance is not autonomously defined here.
    

### **Step 3 — Allocate jurisdiction to the court of that place**

- The court at the place where the obligation must be performed has **special jurisdiction** under Art. 7(1)(a).
    
- This allows litigation in the forum of performance, even if defendant is domiciled elsewhere.

## **What the Three-Step Test _is_**

- A sequential method for identifying jurisdiction based on performance.
    
- A mechanism built on **obligation-by-obligation analysis**.
    
- A way to anchor jurisdiction in the **geographically relevant** forum.

## **What It _is not_**

- Not applicable to:  
    – Sales contracts (Art. 7(1)(b) first indent)  
    – Services contracts (Art. 7(1)(b) second indent)
    
- Not an EU-autonomous definition of performance (Rome I governs the obligation).
    
- Not a merits analysis—purely jurisdictional.
    
- Not a basis for “forum non conveniens.”

## **Illustrative Example**

A Dutch buyer sues a Belgian seller for failure to **deliver** a machine.

1. Obligation forming basis of claim → _delivery_.
    
2. Place of performance → determined by the governing law (e.g., German law says delivery occurs at seller’s place of business unless agreed otherwise).
    
3. Jurisdiction → German courts (if delivery place = Germany).

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

The three-step test under Art. 7(1)(a) allocates jurisdiction by isolating the **specific obligation sued upon**, determining its **performance location** under the governing law, and assigning jurisdiction to that location. It is a **precision tool** for contract-related jurisdiction when Art. 7(1)(b) does not apply.
