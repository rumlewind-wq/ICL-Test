- **Party autonomy**  
    Enforceable expression of parties’ freedom to allocate dispute-resolution risk.
    
- **Predictability and forum control**  
    Central tool for managing litigation exposure, legal certainty, and enforcement strategy.
    
- **Recognised globally**  
    Key instruments:  
    – **[[2005 Hague Choice of Court Convention]]**  
    – **Brussels I / Brussels Ia Regulation** (EU)  
    – National procedural law of the chosen forum

### **What They _are not_**

- Not arbitration agreements (no tribunal, no NYC, no lex arbitri).
    
- Not non-exclusive clauses (those allow parallel litigation in multiple fora).
    
- Not unilateral clauses unless expressly drafted and accepted.
    
- Not substitutes for governing-law clauses (they select forum, not applicable law).

- “The parties agree that the **Commercial Court of Paris** shall have exclusive jurisdiction.”
