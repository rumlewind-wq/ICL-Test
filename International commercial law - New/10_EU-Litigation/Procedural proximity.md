### **Procedural Proximity (general definition – jurisdiction concept)**

**Procedural proximity** refers to the degree to which a **court or legal system has a close procedural connection** to a dispute. It assesses whether the forum has a **natural procedural link** based on factors like evidence location, parties’ procedural expectations, and procedural suitability.

It is a _forum-connection concept_, not a standalone jurisdictional basis.

---

## **Core Meaning**

Procedural proximity examines **how well a court is positioned—procedurally—to handle the case**, based on factors such as:

- Location of witnesses and evidence
    
- Language of documents
    
- Procedural compatibility with the dispute (e.g., disclosure rules, testimony rules)
    
- Parties’ procedural expectations and reliance
    
- Efficiency and manageability of proceedings
    

It reflects the **functional suitability** of a forum.

## **Use Cases**

### **1. Common-law systems**

Procedural proximity is used within **forum non conveniens** analysis (outside the EU).  
Courts weigh whether another forum is procedurally more appropriate.

### **2. International arbitration**

Used when assessing:

- Choice of seat
    
- Procedural efficiency
    
- Evidence gathering limitations (e.g., IBA Rules suitability)
    

### **3. Non-EU jurisdictional analysis**

States not bound by Brussels Ia may evaluate procedural proximity to decide whether to accept or decline jurisdiction.

## **What Procedural Proximity _is_**

- A **practical connection test** evaluating procedural convenience and suitability.
    
- A tool used in **discretionary jurisdiction systems** (e.g., U.S., England pre-Brussels).
    
- A factor balancing fairness, efficiency, and access to key procedural mechanisms.
    
- A way to identify the **procedurally natural forum** for litigation.
    

---

## **What It _is not_**

- Not a jurisdictional ground under **Brussels Ia** (EU rejects forum non conveniens → procedural proximity is irrelevant in the EU).
    
- Not a choice-of-law rule.
    
- Not a basis to override **exclusive choice-of-court** agreements.
    
- Not a merits test—purely procedural.

## **Examples**

- Witnesses, documents, and technical experts are all located in Japan → Japanese courts have strong procedural proximity.
    
- A dispute involves extensive U.S.-style discovery → U.S. courts may have superior procedural proximity.
    
- A contract heavily documented in German and executed by German parties → German courts have higher procedural proximity.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Procedural proximity measures the **procedural suitability and practical connectedness** of a forum. It plays a central role in **forum non conveniens** systems but is **irrelevant under EU law**, where jurisdiction is determined strictly by Brussels Ia without discretionary procedural balancing.
