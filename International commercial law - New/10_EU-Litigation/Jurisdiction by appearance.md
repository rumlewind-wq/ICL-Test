### **Jurisdiction by Appearance (general definition)**

Jurisdiction by appearance arises when a **defendant participates in proceedings before a court without contesting jurisdiction**, thereby **implicitly accepting** that court’s jurisdiction. The defendant’s conduct substitutes for a jurisdiction agreement.

It is a **non-consensual but legally binding** acceptance of forum authority.

### **Legal Basis**

- **Brussels Ia Regulation – Art. 26**  
    A court has jurisdiction when the defendant **enters an appearance** without challenging jurisdiction, _unless_ the appearance is entered solely to contest jurisdiction.
    
- Historically recognised in most national civil-procedure systems.

### **How It Operates**

- **Defendant appears → does not object → court acquires jurisdiction**
    
- Court must notify the defendant of its right to contest jurisdiction (mandatory under Brussels Ia).
    
- If the defendant objects **at the first opportunity**, jurisdiction by appearance does **not** arise.

### **Key Features**

- **Implicit acceptance of jurisdiction**  
    Participation = consent, unless explicitly limited to jurisdictional objection.
    
- **Overrides other jurisdictional bases**  
    Once appearance is entered without objection, defendant cannot later invoke:  
    – Domicile rules  
    – Special jurisdiction rules  
    – Residual jurisdiction rules
    
- **Exception for protected parties**  
    In matters involving consumers, employees, or insured persons, appearance cannot be used to circumvent protective jurisdiction rules.

### **What Jurisdiction by Appearance _is_**

- A procedural mechanism where the defendant’s conduct supplies the court’s jurisdiction.
    
- A binding form of **implicit prorogation**.
    
- A tool preventing tactical or late jurisdictional challenges.

### **What It _is not_**

- Not a substitute for an **exclusive choice of court agreement** (but functionally similar once triggered).
    
- Not valid if appearance is **solely to contest jurisdiction**.
    
- Not available in areas with **mandatory protective jurisdiction** (consumer, insurance, employment).
    
- Not a choice-of-law mechanism—no impact on the **lex contractus**.

### **Examples**

- Defendant files a **substantive defence** without raising jurisdiction → jurisdiction by appearance attaches.
    
- Defendant attends hearing and argues the merits → implied acceptance.
    
- Defendant files a jurisdictional objection first, then argues merits **conditionally** → no jurisdiction by appearance arises.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Jurisdiction by appearance transforms **procedural participation** into **binding jurisdictional consent**. It stabilises litigation by preventing parties from contesting jurisdiction after engaging on the merits.
