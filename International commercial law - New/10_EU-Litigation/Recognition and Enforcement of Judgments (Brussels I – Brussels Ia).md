# [[Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments (Brussels I / Brussels Ia)]]

## Free-circulation regime (source: [[ICL emne fra bøger]])
- Automatic recognition for civil and commercial judgments, near-automatic enforcement, and abolition of exequatur in the Recast
- Universal recognition rule with limited refusal grounds (public policy, default of appearance, irreconcilable judgments)
- Procedural framework: certificate (Art. 53), simplified documentation, and reliance on local enforcement law
- Effects of recognition: res judicata plus enforceability, with a strict prohibition on revision au fond

## Exequatur abolition (source: [[Exequatur abolition – Art. 39]])
Exequatur abolition removes the intermediate declaration-of-enforceability stage. Under Brussels Ia Art. 39 a judgment given in one Member State “shall be enforceable in another without any declaration of enforceability required.” Creditors file the judgment plus the Art. 53 certificate and proceed directly to execution; debtors can only rely on Art. 45 defences after enforcement begins. The reform accelerates cross-border debt collection and embodies mutual trust.

## Grounds for refusal (source: [[Øvelser lektion 4, ICL]])
- **Art. 45(1)(a)** public policy → manifest breaches of fundamental rights; **Krombach** illustrates denial of legal representation as a valid defence
- **Art. 45(1)(b)** default of appearance without proper notice
- **Art. 45(1)(c)–(d)** irreconcilable judgments (earlier domestic or foreign titles take priority)
- **Art. 45(1)(e)** ensures exclusive-jurisdiction matters are respected; Art. 45(3) bars review of the foreign court’s jurisdiction
- **Art. 52** prohibits substantive review; enforcement authorities cannot reassess facts or law

## Case law
- **[[Krombach – Case C-7.98]]**: enforcement may be refused for manifest breaches of fundamental rights (denial of counsel) under the public-policy exception, but the concept remains narrow and controlled by EU law
- **[[Renault – Case C-38.98]]**: public policy cannot be used as a disguised appeal; differences in substantive law outcomes are irrelevant because Art. 52 forbids merits review
- **[[Denilauler – Case 125.79]]**: provisional, ex parte measures issued without hearing the defendant fall outside automatic recognition; such orders must rely on national law for enforcement

## Structural principles (sources: [[Revision au fond]]; [[No review of merits rule]])
- **Révision au fond** is prohibited: enforcing courts cannot re-evaluate facts, law, evidence, or damage calculations; only procedural or structural defences are permitted
- **No review of merits rule**: enforcement courts are not appellate bodies; they only test enumerated grounds (public policy, notice, jurisdiction) and must accept the foreign decision’s substance

## Enforcement stages (sources: [[Voluntary compliance]]; [[Forced compliance]])
- **Voluntary compliance**: debtor satisfies the judgment or arbitral award without coercion, often after negotiations or once enforceability is clear
- **Forced compliance**: creditor activates state enforcement machinery (asset seizures, garnishments, judicial sales) under lex fori executionis after recognition; EU judgments circulate as domestic titles, while national procedures govern actual execution
