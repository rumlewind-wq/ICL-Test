### **Exequatur Abolition (Brussels Ia Recast 2012 – Regulation 1215/2012)**

**Definition**  
Exequatur abolition is the **removal of the intermediate “declaration of enforceability” procedure** for EU judgments under the **Brussels Ia Recast (2012)**.  
Judgments from one Member State are now **automatically enforceable** in any other Member State **without** needing prior authorisation from the enforcing court.

It is a **core reform** of the 2012 Recast.

## **What Changed?**

### **Before 2012 (Brussels I Regulation 44/2001)**

- A foreign EU judgment required **exequatur** in the enforcing State.
    
- Creditor had to obtain a **declaration of enforceability** before starting execution.
    
- Debtor could oppose exequatur before enforcement even began.
    

### **After 2012 (Brussels Ia Regulation 1215/2012)**

- **No exequatur stage.**
    
- Foreign judgments circulate **as if they were domestic judgments**.
    
- Enforcement begins **immediately**, using local execution procedures.
    
- Debtor may only resist enforcement via **limited defences** after enforcement is initiated.

## **Legal Basis**

- **Brussels Ia, Art. 39**  
    → Judgment given in one Member State shall be enforceable in another without any declaration of enforceability required.
    
- **Arts. 41–44**  
    → Creditor only needs a **certificate of judgment** (Art. 53) and a copy of the judgment.
    
- **Arts. 45–46**  
    → Only **limited refusal grounds** (public policy, default of appearance without notice, irreconcilability).
    

No merits review (révision au fond prohibited).

## **What Exequatur Abolition _is_**

- A shift to **automatic, unmediated enforcement** of EU judgments.
    
- A procedural streamlining delivering **speed, efficiency, and legal certainty**.
    
- A central feature of the EU’s **mutual trust** system.
    
- A reduction of debtor opportunities to delay enforcement.
    

---

## **What It _is not_**

- Not an elimination of **defences** — refusal grounds still exist (Art. 45).
    
- Not a removal of **domestic execution law** — enforcement still follows lex fori executionis.
    
- Not applicable to **non-EU judgments** — only applies within the EU.
    
- Not a change to arbitration — arbitral awards remain under the New York Convention.
    

---

## **Practical Effects**

- Enforcement speed increases dramatically (no preliminary proceeding).
    
- Creditors file judgment + Art. 53 certificate directly with enforcement authorities.
    
- Debtors must argue refusal grounds **reactively**, not proactively.
    
- Cross-border debt collection becomes **faster and cheaper**.
    
- Eliminates prior litigation over enforceability.
    

---

## **Examples**

- A Dutch monetary judgment is enforceable in Spain **immediately**, without intermediate court proceedings.
    
- A German injunction is enforceable in Italy once the Art. 53 certificate is produced (subject to local remedies).
    
- A French cost order is enforced in Denmark like a domestic judgment — no exequatur application required.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Exequatur abolition under the Brussels Ia Recast transforms EU judgments into **automatically enforceable instruments**, eliminating the intermediate authorisation stage and embedding **mutual trust and procedural efficiency** at the heart of EU cross-border civil justice.
