Renault, Case C-38/98


----
### **Renault, Case C-38/98**

  

**Facts**

- Renault obtained a French judgment against a Belgian company for copyright infringement concerning car parts.
    
- Belgian law did **not protect** the same design rights at the time.
    
- Renault sought **recognition and enforcement** of the French judgment in Belgium under the Brussels Convention.
    
- Belgian company argued enforcement should be refused because the judgment conflicted with Belgian substantive law.

**Legal Question**

- Can recognition and enforcement be refused under **public policy (Art. 27(1) Brussels Convention)** solely because the foreign court applied different substantive law than the law of the enforcing state?
    

---

**Holding (ECJ)**

- **No.**
    
- Recognition **cannot be refused** merely because the foreign judgment would have been decided differently under the enforcing state’s law.
    
- **Public policy defense is limited** to _manifest breaches of fundamental principles_, not mere differences in substantive rules.
    
- Review of the merits of the judgment is **prohibited** (Art. 29 → now Art. 52 Brussels I Recast).

**Key Legal Principle**

- Public policy **cannot be used as a disguised appeal** on the merits.
    
- Only applies where enforcement would result in a **manifest and unacceptable breach of fundamental rights or principles** in the enforcing state.
    
- Confirms the **two pillars** of Brussels I:
    
    1. **No substantive review** (Art. 52).
        
    2. **Strict, exceptional use of public policy** (Art. 45.1.a).

**Significance**

- Reinforces mutual trust between Member States.
    
- Shows the narrow scope of public policy defense:
    
    - _Krombach_: refusal allowed due to fundamental rights violation.
        
    - _Renault_: refusal **not allowed** for mere differences in law or outcome.
