Effer, Case 38/81


---
**Effer, Case 38/81**

  

The Court interpreted **Brussels Convention, art. 5(1)** (now **Brussels I, art. 7(1)(a)**) on jurisdiction in **contract disputes** when the **existence of the contract itself is contested**.

  

**Facts:**

- **Effer**, an Italian company, contracted with a German company to supply goods.
    
- The defendant argued that **no valid contract** existed.
    
- Question: Can a court apply art. 5(1) when the very **existence of the contract is in dispute**?
    

  

**Holding:**

- **Yes.** The special jurisdiction rule in art. 5(1) applies **even if the defendant contests the existence of the contract**.
    
- The court must **first establish whether a contract exists** as part of its assessment of the claim.
    
- This ensures jurisdiction is not undermined by a party simply denying the contract.
    

  

**Significance:**

- Strengthened **legal certainty** by preventing defendants from avoiding jurisdiction through formal denial.
    
- Confirmed that jurisdictional analysis precedes substantive ruling on validity.
    
- Important in early Brussels case law for contract disputes.
