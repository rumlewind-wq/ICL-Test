Tacconi, Case C- 334/00


----
**Tacconi, Case C-334/00**

  

The Court held that **pre-contractual liability** (e.g., **culpa in contrahendo**) does **not** fall under **Brussels I, art. 7(1)** (contract jurisdiction) because there is **no binding agreement**.

  

Instead, such disputes fall under **art. 7(2)** (tort jurisdiction).

This clarified the boundary between contractual and non-contractual claims in cross-border negotiations.
