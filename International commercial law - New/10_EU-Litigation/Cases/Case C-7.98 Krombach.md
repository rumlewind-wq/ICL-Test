Krombach, Case C-7/98



# Krombach and Renault Judgments
22. It follows that, while the Contracting States in principle remain free, by virtue of the proviso in Article 27, point 1, of the Convention, to determine, according to their own conceptions, what public policy requires, the limits of that concept are a matter for interpretation of the Convention.

23. Recourse to the public-policy clause in Article 27, point 1, of the Convention can be envisaged only where recognition or enforcement of the judgment delivered in another Contracting State would be at variance to an unacceptable degree with the legal order of the State in which enforcement is sought inasmuch as it infringes a fundamental principle. In order for the prohibition of any review of the foreign judgment as to its substance to be observed, the infringement would have to constitute a manifest breach of a rule of law regarded as essential in the legal order of the State in which enforcement is sought or of a right recognized as being fundamental within that legal order.

### **Krombach, Case C-7/98**

  

**Facts**

- German doctor (Krombach) sued in France for causing the death of a French minor during a medical procedure in Germany.
    
- French criminal court convicted Krombach _in absentia_ and awarded civil damages to the victim’s family.
    
- Under French law, a defendant accused of a serious crime could only be represented by counsel if present in person.
    
- Krombach did not appear due to health reasons and therefore was **denied legal representation**.
    
- Victim’s family sought enforcement of the French judgment in Germany under the Brussels Convention.

**Legal Question**

- Can Germany refuse recognition and enforcement under **public policy (Art. 27(1) Brussels Convention)** when the foreign judgment was rendered without respecting fundamental rights of defense?
    

---

**Holding (ECJ)**

- Recognition **can be refused** under public policy if enforcement would **manifestly infringe a fundamental principle of the legal order** of the state addressed.
    
- Denying the defendant legal representation constitutes a **manifest and serious breach of fundamental rights**.
    
- Germany was therefore entitled to refuse enforcement.

**Key Legal Principle**

- **Public Policy (Art. 27(1) → now Art. 45.1.a Brussels I Recast):**
    
    - National concept, but **interpreted restrictively** under EU law.
        
    - May only be invoked for **manifest breaches** of essential legal principles or fundamental rights.
        
    - ECJ sets the outer limits of public policy to prevent misuse.

**Significance**

- Clarifies the balance between mutual trust and fundamental rights.
    
- Establishes that **serious violations of procedural rights**, such as the right to be heard, can justify refusal of recognition.
    
- Often cited with _Renault, Case C-38/98_ to define limits of public policy defense.
