**Custom Made Commercial, Case C-288/92**

  

The Court interpreted **Brussels Convention, art. 5(1)** (now **Brussels I, art. 7(1)(a)**) regarding **commission agency agreements**.

  

**Facts:**

- A Danish company appointed a UK agent to **promote and sell its products** in the UK.
    
- Dispute arose over unpaid commissions.
    
- Question: What is the **place of performance** for the agent’s obligations under the agreement?
    

  

**Holding:**

- The **place of performance** is the location where the **agent principally carried out the activities** agreed upon,
    
    provided this place can be clearly determined.
    
- If there are activities in several states with no clear main center, the general rule applies → **defendant’s domicile** under **art. 4**.
    

  

**Significance:**

- Clarified jurisdiction for **distribution and agency contracts**.
    
- Strengthened **predictability** by linking jurisdiction to the agent’s core business activities.
    
- Laid groundwork for the later, more specific rules introduced in **Brussels I, art. 7(1)(b)** for services.
