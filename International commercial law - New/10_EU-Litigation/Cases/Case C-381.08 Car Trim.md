**Car Trim, Case C-381/08**

  

The Court clarified **Brussels I, art. 7(1)(b)** regarding **contracts for sale of goods vs. provision of services**.

  

**Facts:**

- German company **Car Trim** supplied parts to Italian company **KeySafety Systems**.
    
- Dispute arose over whether the contract was for **sale of goods** or **services**, which determines jurisdiction.
    

  

**Holding:**

- A contract qualifies as **sale of goods** when:
    
    1. The supplier is **obliged to deliver goods**, and
        
    2. The purchaser **does not provide the majority of materials** needed for production.
        
    
- The **place of delivery**, as agreed in the contract, determines jurisdiction.
    
- If unclear, it is where the goods were **physically handed over to the first carrier** for transport to the buyer.
    

  

**Significance:**

- Set a **uniform EU definition** for distinguishing sales from services.
    
- Limited forum shopping by clarifying the key jurisdictional criterion in cross-border manufacturing contracts.
