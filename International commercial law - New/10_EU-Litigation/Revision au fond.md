### **Révision au fond (general definition – prohibition in international enforcement)**

**Révision au fond** is the principle that a court **may not review the merits** of a foreign judgment or arbitral award when deciding on **recognition or enforcement**.  
The enforcing court is **strictly prohibited** from re-examining:

- the facts,
    
- the law,
    
- the evidence, or
    
- the correctness of the decision.
    

It is a **non-review rule**, foundational to cross-border enforcement.

## **Core Meaning**

When enforcing a foreign judgment/award, the court **cannot ask**:

- Whether the tribunal or foreign court correctly applied the law
    
- Whether evidence was weighed properly
    
- Whether the decision is substantively right or fair
    
- Whether damages were excessive or insufficient
    

→ Only **procedural and structural defences** may be examined (public policy, due process, jurisdiction, etc.).

## **Legal Sources**

- **New York Convention (NYC)** → implicit prohibition (Art. V is exhaustive).
    
- **Brussels Ia Regulation** → explicit: _no review of jurisdiction and no review of substance_.
    
- **Hague Judgments Convention (2019)** → prohibits merits review.
    
- **UNCITRAL Model Law** → annulment courts may not re-open merits.
    

This creates a **global no-merits-review standard**.

## **What Révision au Fond _is_**

- A rule prohibiting **substantive re-evaluation** of foreign decisions.
    
- A guarantee that enforcement courts engage only in **limited, enumerated checks**.
    
- A mechanism ensuring the **finality and efficiency** of international dispute resolution.
    
- A counterpart to the **mirror rule** (enforcing courts replicate effect, not reasoning).

## **What It _is not_**

- Not a bar to procedural review → courts may examine:  
    – Public policy  
    – Due process  
    – Proper notice  
    – Arbitrability  
    – Validity of the arbitration agreement  
    – Recognition defences in Art. V NYC or Arts. 45–46 Brussels Ia
    
- Not applicable to **appeals** in the State of origin (merits reviews happen _there_).
    
- Not a guarantee that all errors are immune → but errors are irrelevant at enforcement stage.
    

---

## **Illustrative Examples**

- A tribunal misapplies governing law → _enforcing court cannot correct it_.
    
- A judgment miscalculates damages → _no merits correction allowed_.
    
- A court disagrees with foreign reasoning → _irrelevant_.
    
- A foreign award looks “unfair” economically → _enforcement still required_ unless public policy is violated.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Révision au fond establishes a **strict prohibition** on merits review during recognition and enforcement. Enforcement courts may conduct only **enumerated, structural checks**, safeguarding the **speed, predictability, and integrity** of international enforcement regimes.
