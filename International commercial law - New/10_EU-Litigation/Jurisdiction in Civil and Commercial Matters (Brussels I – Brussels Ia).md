# [[Jurisdiction in Civil and Commercial Matters (Brussels I / Brussels Ia)]]

## Scope and architecture (source: [[ICL emne fra bøger]])
- Historical development of the Brussels regime, material/territorial scope, and defendant’s domicile as the general jurisdictional hook
- Special jurisdiction in contract (place of performance) and tort (place of harmful event)
- Weak-party regimes for insurance, consumer, and employment contracts
- Exclusive jurisdiction categories, prorogation/choice-of-court agreements, jurisdiction by appearance, and residual jurisdiction
- Lis pendens, related actions, and interaction with third-state proceedings
- Multi-party disputes plus ancillary claims under the Regulation

## Regulation roadmap (source: [[Bestemmelseoversigt ICL]])
- **Chapter I – Scope and definitions**: Art. 1 covers civil and commercial matters with exclusions (status, insolvency, arbitration, wills, family law); Art. 2 defines “court”, “judgment”, and “Member State of origin”
- **General jurisdiction**: Art. 4 (defendant’s domicile) and Art. 5 (persons domiciled outside the EU → national law); Art. 6 handles lis pendens with third-state proceedings
- **Special jurisdiction** (Art. 7–8): contract (Art. 7(1)(a–b) distinguishing sales vs. services), tort (Art. 7(2)), branch operations, trusts, salvage, civil claims tied to criminal proceedings, and multi-defendant/third-party joinder mechanics
- **Protective sections**: insurance (Arts. 9–16), consumer (Arts. 17–19), employment (Arts. 20–23) ensure weaker parties can sue (or be sued) only in specific fora
- **Choice-of-court agreements**: Art. 25 formal requirements, Art. 26 jurisdiction by appearance, and Art. 31(2) reverse lis pendens for exclusive clauses

## Case references
- **[[Car Trim – Case C-381,08]]**: clarified Art. 7(1)(b) for sales vs. services—sale exists when the supplier must deliver goods and the purchaser does not provide most materials; delivery place is the agreed handover location or first carrier handover if unclear
- **[[Color Drack – Case C-204.08]]**: for sales with multiple delivery points within one Member State, jurisdiction lies at the principal delivery place (based on agreement or factual significance); if no principal place exists, claimant may sue at any delivery location in that State
- **[[Custom Made Commercial – Case C-288,92]]**: under the pre-Recast Art. 5(1), commission/agency obligations confer jurisdiction where the agent principally performed activities, provided the place is clearly identifiable
- **[[CarsOnTheWeb – Case C-322.14]]**: click-wrap acceptance of standard terms (including jurisdiction clauses) satisfies Art. 25(1)(a) so long as users can access, store, or print the conditions before contract conclusion
- **[[Three-step test – Art. 7(1)(a)]]**: identifies the obligation in question, characterises its place of performance under the applicable law, and assigns jurisdiction to that location when Art. 7(1)(b) does not apply
- **[[Bier – Case 21.76]]**: Art. 7(2) tort jurisdiction allows suing either at the place where the harmful event originated or where the damage occurred (double head of jurisdiction)
- **[[Shevill – Case C-68.93]]** and **[[eDate – Case C-509.09]]**: defamation claims may be brought at the publisher’s domicile for full damages, in each distribution state for territorial damages (mosaic approach), and—online—at the victim’s centre of interests for full damages
- **[[Tacconi – Case C-334.00]]**: pre-contractual liability (culpa in contrahendo) falls under Art. 7(2) tort jurisdiction, not Art. 7(1) contract
- **[[Gasser – Case 116.02]]**: pre-Recast Art. 29 forced second-seised chosen courts to stay proceedings until the first-seised court decided jurisdiction, enabling Italian torpedoes
- **[[Owusu - Case C-281,02]]**: Art. 4 (defendant’s domicile) is mandatory; Member State courts cannot decline jurisdiction via forum non conveniens even if the dispute is closely linked to a non-EU forum

## Protective jurisdiction snapshot (source: [[ICL topics som slettes delvist når lavet]])
- Insurance contracts (Arts. 9–16): policyholder, insured, or beneficiary can sue in their domicile; insurers have limited fora
- Consumer contracts (Arts. 17–19): consumers may sue in their domicile; traders can sue consumers only there
- Employment contracts (Arts. 20–23): employees sue in habitual place of work or employer domicile; employers sue only where the employee is domiciled

## Procedural safeguards (sources: [[Lis pendens]]; [[Reverse lis pendens]]; [[Forum non conveniens (EU rejection)]])
- Lis pendens stay/decline cycle is automatic and ex officio
- Reverse lis pendens prioritises chosen courts and neutralises torpedo actions
- Forum non conveniens is unavailable under Brussels Ia—courts must hear cases when the Regulation confers jurisdiction
