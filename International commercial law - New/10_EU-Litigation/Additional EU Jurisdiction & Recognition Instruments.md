- [[Brussels II]] regime for marriage dissolution (jurisdiction + recognition) and parental responsibility (jurisdiction, enforcement, cooperation)
- [[Maintenance Regulation]] addressing jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition, and enforcement of maintenance decisions
- [[Succession Regulation]] coordinating jurisdiction, applicable law, and recognition for cross-border estates
- Regulations on property aspects of marriages and registered partnerships
- Personal protection measures in civil matters plus related regulations/directives on civil cooperation

## Syllabus references (source: [[Eksamensdokument ICL]])

- These instruments supplement but do not replace the Brussels/Rome core; they remain supportive reading rather than core exam focus
