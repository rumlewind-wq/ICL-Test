**Pathological arbitration clauses (general definition)**  
Pathological arbitration clauses are **defective, unclear, or incomplete arbitration agreements** that create uncertainty about _whether_, _how_, or _where_ arbitration should proceed. They undermine effective dispute resolution and generate jurisdictional challenges, procedural delays, and enforceability risks.

They are the opposite of a properly drafted, functional arbitration clause.

### **Core Characteristics**

Pathological clauses typically exhibit one or more of the following defects:

- **Unclear or inconsistent dispute-resolution mechanism**  
    e.g., “Disputes shall be settled by arbitration or courts in X.”
    
- **Incorrect identification of an arbitral institution**  
    e.g., “Arbitration under the rules of the International Chamber of London” (non-existent body).
    
- **Incomplete procedural framework**  
    e.g., no rules, no seat, no appointing authority, no method for tribunal constitution.
    
- **Contradictory provisions**  
    e.g., specifying _both_ ICC arbitration and national court litigation as exclusive mechanisms.
    
- **Invalid or unenforceable elements**  
    e.g., arbitration for non-arbitrable matters, mandatory unilateral clauses without proper drafting.
    
- **Impossibility of execution**  
    e.g., reference to an institution that has been dissolved, or procedures that violate lex arbitri.

### **Typical Examples**

- “Arbitration shall be handled by the Court of Arbitration of Geneva” (no such institution).
    
- “Any dispute shall be solved by ICC arbitration in Denmark under English law in the court of Stockholm.”
    
- “Arbitration will be held, if necessary, before an arbitrator appointed by the parties” (no fallback if parties disagree).
    
- “Arbitration in accordance with international law and fairness, but administered by no institution and with no rules.”

### **What Pathological Clauses _are_**

- Clauses that **fail to establish a workable arbitration mechanism**.
    
- Sources of **jurisdictional disputes**, **annulment risk**, and **NYC enforcement failures**.
    
- Problems that often require courts or institutions to “salvage” the clause using default mechanisms.

### **What They _are not_**

- Not automatically void—many legal systems attempt to **cure** defective clauses where possible (“effective interpretation”).
    
- Not the same as _unfavourable_ clauses; they are **non-functional**, not merely imbalanced.
    
- Not always fatal; courts may reconstruct intent if the parties clearly intended arbitration.

### **Legal Treatment**

- **Pro-arbitration jurisdictions** (e.g., France, Switzerland, Model Law states):  
    Tend to uphold arbitration if parties’ intention is clear, even with defects.
    
- **Institutions** like ICC, LCIA, SCC often **support clause rescue** by:  
    – Naming the appointing authority  
    – Applying standard rules  
    – Replacing defective references
    
- **New York Convention Art. II**  
    Requires an “agreement in writing,” but will invalidate clauses that are too vague or unworkable.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Pathological arbitration clauses create **operational breakdowns** in dispute resolution. They trigger avoidable litigation, delay, and enforceability risk. Modern drafting practice prioritises clarity, institutional rules, and precise designation of seat, rules, and appointing authority to avoid pathology.
