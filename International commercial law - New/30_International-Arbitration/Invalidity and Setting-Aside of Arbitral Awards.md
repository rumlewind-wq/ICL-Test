# [[Invalidity and Setting-Aside of Arbitral Awards]]

## Course framing (source: [[ICL emne fra bøger]])
- Seat-court control mechanisms under Model Law art. 34, including jurisdictional defects, procedural irregularities, arbitrability, public policy, time limits, effects of set-aside (nullity, remittal, partial annulment), and the absence of merits review

## Model Law Art. 34 (source: [[Model Law Art. 34 – annulment]])
Art. 34 supplies the exclusive seat-based grounds for setting aside an award. Challenges must be brought before the courts at the seat and focus on enumerated procedural/jurisdictional defects.

## Grounds and illustrations
- **Subject-matter non-arbitrability (source: [[Subject-matter non-arbitrable – Art. 34(2)(b)(i)]])**: awards may be annulled if the dispute concerns non-arbitrable subject matter (criminal, family, insolvency, patent validity with erga omnes effect, administrative acts)
- **Public policy (source: [[Arbitral Award#NYC Art. V / Model Law Art. 34 grounds linked to awards|Award contrary to public policy – Art. 34(2)(b)(ii)]])**: covers corruption, fraud, fundamental fairness violations, or breaches of mandatory norms; mirrors NYC Art. V(2)(b)
- **Excess of mandate / ultra petita (source: [[Ultra petita – Art. 34(2)(a)(iii)]])**: tribunals cannot decide issues beyond the submission to arbitration or grant unrequested relief; excess portions may be severed
- **Procedural irregularities**: due process failures (notice, opportunity to present case) or improper tribunal composition fall under Art. 34(2)(a)(ii)/(iv)
- **Arbitrability examples (source: [[Patent validity disputes (state or public interest)]])**: arbitrators cannot revoke patents erga omnes; awards purporting to do so risk annulment under non-arbitrability grounds

## Partial annulment and vacatur (sources: [[Partial annulment]]; [[Arbitral Award#Post-award control|Vacated award]])
- Courts may set aside only the defective portion if it is severable, preserving the remainder for enforcement
- A vacated award is one annulled at the seat; such annulment is a ground for refusal of recognition under NYC Art. V(1)(e)

## Manifest injustice safety valve (source: [[Manifest injustice test]])
Some jurisdictions invoke a manifest injustice test as an exceptional safeguard, allowing intervention when an award—though procedurally compliant—produces an outcome so egregious that it violates fundamental justice. This remains distinct from merits review and typically overlaps with public policy analysis.
