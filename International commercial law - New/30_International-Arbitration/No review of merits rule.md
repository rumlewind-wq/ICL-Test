### **No Review of Merits Rule (general definition – international enforcement)**

The **no review of merits rule** is the principle that a court asked to **recognise or enforce** a foreign judgment or arbitral award **may not review the substance of the decision**.  
The enforcing court is **strictly prohibited** from reassessing facts, law, reasoning, evidence, or correctness.

It is a **foundational rule** of Brussels Ia, the New York Convention, the Hague Judgments Convention, and the UNCITRAL Model Law.

## **Core Meaning**

Enforcement courts **cannot** ask:

- Did the foreign court/tribunal apply the law correctly?
    
- Did it properly assess the evidence?
    
- Did the tribunal miscalculate damages?
    
- Was the reasoning persuasive or consistent?
    

These questions are **irrelevant** at the enforcement stage.

The enforcing court only checks **enumerated procedural defences** (public policy, due process, jurisdiction, notice, etc.).

---

## **Legal Anchors**

- **Brussels Ia**: Explicit prohibition on reviewing jurisdiction and merits.
    
- **New York Convention**: Art. V is **exhaustive**—no merits review permitted.
    
- **UNCITRAL Model Law**: Annulment is limited; no merits review.
    
- **Hague Judgments Convention**: Express no-review rule.
    

This creates a **global consensus**: enforcement courts must not “second-guess” foreign decisions.

## **What the No Review of Merits Rule _is_**

- A **non-intervention principle** protecting finality of foreign decisions.
    
- A structural requirement that enforcement be limited to **procedural and structural grounds**.
    
- A guarantee that the enforcing court is **not an appellate court** over foreign decisions.
    
- A counterpart to **révision au fond** (same principle in French terminology).

## **What It _is not_**

- Not a bar to procedural review → courts may check:  
    – Public policy violations  
    – Lack of notice  
    – Invalid arbitration agreement  
    – Non-arbitrability  
    – Irreconcilable judgments
    
- Not a mechanism to correct substantive errors (even obvious ones).
    
- Not a way to revisit damages, legal interpretation, or factual findings.
    
- Not a merits appeal.
    

---

## **Examples**

- Arbitration award applies the wrong governing law → enforcement **must still proceed** unless a procedural violation is proven.
    
- Foreign judgment overestimates damages → enforcing court **cannot adjust** the amount.
    
- Tribunal reasons poorly or inconsistently → enforcement unaffected.
    
- A national court disagrees with how the foreign court interpreted a contract → **irrelevant**.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

The no review of merits rule ensures that **enforcement courts do not act as appellate tribunals**. Recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments and arbitral awards are limited to **strict procedural defences**, preserving speed, predictability, and the finality of international dispute resolution.
