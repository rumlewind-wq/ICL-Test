# [[Arbitration Procedure and Applicable Law]]

## Course outline (source: [[ICL emne fra bøger]])
- Lex arbitri / seat law, party autonomy for procedure, institutional vs. ad hoc frameworks, applicable substantive law selection, judicial assistance (appointment, interim measures, evidence), and optional evidentiary tools (IBA Rules)

## Lex arbitri (source: [[Lex arbitri]])
The lex arbitri is the law of the seat of arbitration. It supplies the mandatory procedural framework (tribunal constitution, due process, interim measures, annulment routes), defines supervisory court jurisdiction, and determines the award’s nationality for New York Convention purposes. It is distinct from the lex contractus and institutional rules.

## Curial law (source: [[Curial law]])
Curial law refers to the procedural rulebook chosen by the parties—usually institutional rules (ICC, LCIA, SCC, UNCITRAL Rules) or bespoke arrangements. It governs submissions, evidence, hearings, and case management but remains subordinate to the lex arbitri’s mandatory provisions.

## Lex contractus vs. transnational norms (sources: [[Lex contractus]]; [[Lex mercatoria]])
- **Lex contractus**: the substantive law governing the contract, selected via party autonomy or conflict rules (Rome I). It determines interpretation, performance, breach, and remedies, independent of seat law or procedural rules.
- **Lex mercatoria**: a body of transnational commercial norms (trade usages, UNIDROIT Principles, PECL, INCOTERMS, UCP 600). Arbitrators may apply it when authorised (e.g., “rules of law”), offering a neutral alternative to national systems.

## Equity-based mandates (source: [[Ex aequo et bono]])
Ex aequo et bono authority lets arbitrators decide disputes according to equity and commercial fairness rather than strict legal rules, but only with explicit party consent (Model Law Art. 28(3)). The tribunal must still observe due process and public policy limits.

## Interim and injunctive relief (sources: [[Interim measures]]; [[Injunctive relief]])
- Interim measures maintain the status quo, preserve assets, or secure evidence to protect the effectiveness of the final award
- Injunctive relief (prohibitory, mandatory, freezing, anti-suit, emergency) prevents irreparable harm, stabilises contractual relations, and may be ordered by tribunals or supportive courts depending on the lex arbitri
