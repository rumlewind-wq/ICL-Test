### **Ex Aequo et Bono (general definition – arbitration)**

**Ex aequo et bono** means that an arbitral tribunal decides the dispute **according to equity and fairness**, rather than by applying any particular national substantive law.  
It is an _exceptional mode of decision-making_ and requires **explicit party authorisation**.

It reflects the idea that the tribunal may decide **“what is right and just”** in commercial terms, not necessarily what the law strictly dictates.

---

## **Core Characteristics**

- **Equity-based decision-making**  
    Tribunal resolves the dispute by applying principles of fairness and commercial reasonableness.
    
- **No binding substantive law**  
    The tribunal is not bound by the lex contractus when rendering the award.
    
- **Requires explicit agreement**  
    Parties must clearly empower the tribunal to decide ex aequo et bono (Model Law Art. 28(3)).
    
- **Recognised across arbitration frameworks**  
    Institutional rules (ICC, LCIA, UNCITRAL) allow it only with express consent.

## **What Ex Aequo et Bono _is_**

- A **non-legal, fairness-driven** adjudicative method.
    
- A tool for resolving disputes where strict legal outcomes may be commercially unreasonable.
    
- A contractual authorisation permitting the tribunal to prioritise equity over rules.
    
- An exception to the default obligation to apply the governing law.
    

---

## **What It _is not_**

- Not the same as **amiable compositeur** (which softens law rather than replaces it).
    
- Not a licence for arbitrary decisions—tribunals must still respect:  
    – Due process  
    – Equality of arms  
    – Public policy  
    – Mandatory seat law
    
- Not applicable by implication—must be **expressly** authorised.
    

---

## **Practical Examples**

- Parties include: “The arbitrators shall decide ex aequo et bono.”
    
- Tribunal awards equitable compensation not strictly supported by contract wording.
    
- Tribunal adjusts obligations in long-term relational contracts to reach a commercially fair outcome.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Ex aequo et bono empowers arbitrators to issue awards based on **equity, fairness, and commercial justice**, but only if the parties **explicitly consent**. The tribunal’s discretion is broad, yet always constrained by due process and public policy.


### **Ex Aequo et Bono Authority (general definition – arbitration)**

**Ex aequo et bono** authority is the power given to an arbitral tribunal to decide a dispute **based on equity and fairness**, rather than on strict legal rules.  
The tribunal resolves the case according to what is **just and reasonable**, not according to any specific national law.

It is an **exceptional adjudicative mandate** requiring **explicit party consent**.

---

## **Core Meaning**

When authorised ex aequo et bono, the tribunal may:

- Depart from the **applicable substantive law**
    
- Decide by **equitable considerations**
    
- Apply commercial reasonableness and fairness principles
    
- Tailor outcomes based on **equitable justice**, not strict legal doctrine
    

It is broader than “amiable compositeur” authority in some jurisdictions.

---

## **Legal Requirements**

- **Explicit agreement** by the parties (cannot be implied).
    
- Typically included in the arbitration clause or agreed post-dispute.
    
- Many institutional rules allow it only when parties expressly empower the tribunal (e.g., ICC, LCIA, UNCITRAL Rules).
    

Without express authorisation → the tribunal **must** apply the chosen lex contractus.

---

## **What Ex Aequo et Bono Authority _is_**

- A **fairness-based adjudicative mandate**.
    
- A permission for arbitrators to decide **outside strict legal rules**.
    
- A mode of decision-making recognised in most arbitration statutes (Model Law Art. 28(3)).
    
- An alternative to strictly applying national law.
    

---

## **What It _is not_**

- Not permission to disregard **due process** or mandatory seat law.
    
- Not a basis for arbitrary or unpredictable decisions.
    
- Not applicable without **explicit, unambiguous consent**.
    
- Not a replacement for public policy limits—awards remain subject to annulment and NYC Art. V controls.
    

---

## **Key Distinction**

**Ex aequo et bono** vs **Amiable Compositeur**:

- _Amiable compositeur_: tribunal applies the chosen law **but may temper its application** on equitable grounds.
    
- _Ex aequo et bono_: tribunal **does not apply any national law** as binding; decides purely on equity.
    

(Not all jurisdictions draw this distinction, but many institutional rules do.)

---

## **Use Cases**

- Long-term contracts where strict legal outcomes would be commercially unreasonable
    
- Joint venture, partnership, or relational contracts
    
- Situations requiring equitable risk allocation
    
- When parties seek a **business-oriented** rather than technical legal outcome
    

---

## **Examples**

- Parties state: “The tribunal shall decide ex aequo et bono.”  
    → Arbitrators may depart from legal rules and decide on fairness.
    
- Tribunal determines a commercially reasonable solution for a disrupted supply chain despite no legal entitlement under the contract.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Ex aequo et bono authority enables arbitrators to decide disputes **on equitable fairness rather than strict law**, but **only with explicit party consent**. It provides maximum flexibility while remaining constrained by due process, the lex arbitri, and public policy at the annulment/enforcement stage.
