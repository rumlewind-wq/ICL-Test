### **Interim Measures – Functions and Types**

- **Interim measures – maintain status quo**  
    Measures aimed at **freezing the legal or factual situation** until the final award is issued.  
    Typical objectives:  
    – Preventing a party from altering rights or contractual positions  
    – Preventing termination or suspension of performance  
    – Preserving the operational equilibrium of the dispute  
    Common examples: orders not to call a bank guarantee; prohibiting disposal of key assets; preventing a party from disrupting ongoing operations.
    
- **Interim measures – preserve assets**  
    Measures designed to **secure assets** so that any eventual award can be effectively enforced.  
    Objective: avoid the **dissipation, concealment, or transfer** of assets.  
    Examples: asset-freezing orders; prohibiting bank transfers; security for costs; conservatory attachment.  
    These measures ensure the respondent cannot frustrate enforcement by dissipating assets during the arbitration.
    
- **Interim measures – preserve evidence**  
    Measures ensuring **critical evidence is not lost, destroyed, or altered** before the tribunal resolves the dispute.  
    Examples: orders to retain documents; on-site inspections; document preservation mandates; forensic imaging of data; mandatory disclosure of specific evidence.  
    Purpose: safeguard the factual basis of the arbitration to avoid evidentiary prejudice.
