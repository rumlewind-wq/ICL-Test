**Lex arbitri — concise operational definition**

**Definition**  
The _lex arbitri_ is the **law of the seat of arbitration**. It supplies the **mandatory procedural framework** governing the arbitral process (appointment/removal of arbitrators, due process standards, admissibility of challenges, court assistance, annulment routes). It acts as the arbitration’s “supervisory law”.

**What it _is_**

- **Procedural law of the arbitral seat** (e.g., Model Law if seated in Singapore; Arbitration Act 1996 if London).
    
- **Default procedural infrastructure** unless the parties agree otherwise (subject to mandatory rules).
    
- **Source of supervisory court jurisdiction** (constitution of tribunal, interim measures, set-aside proceedings).
    
- **Determinant of award validity** (grounds for annulment are anchored in the lex arbitri).
    

**What it _is not_**

- **Not the substantive law of the contract** (that is the _lex contractus_, chosen via Rome I or party autonomy).
    
- **Not the institutional rules** (e.g., ICC, LCIA, UNCITRAL Rules — these are _party-chosen procedural rules_, subordinate to the lex arbitri).
    
- **Not public international law** (applies even in cross-border disputes between private parties).
    
- **Not the New York Convention system** (NYC governs _enforcement_, not _conduct_ of arbitration).
    

**Practical examples**

- Parties choose **Paris** as seat. The **French Arbitration Law** becomes the lex arbitri. Challenges and procedural supervision run through French courts.
    
- Arbitration seated in **Copenhagen** under **ICC Rules**. ICC Rules govern procedure contractually, but mandatory procedural safeguards (e.g., due process) stem from **Danish Arbitration Act**.
    
- Arbitration seated in **Singapore** with English law as substantive governing law.
    
    - **Lex arbitri** = Singapore Arbitration Act / Model Law
        
    - **[[Lex contractus]]** = English law
        

**Quick corporate-style takeaway**  
Lex arbitri defines the _regulatory operating system_ of an arbitration. It anchors due process, procedural legality, and court-supervisory interfaces. It is mandatory, seat-driven, and distinct from both substantive law and institutional rulebooks.
