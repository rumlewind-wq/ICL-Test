### **Reciprocity Reservations under the New York Convention (NYC Art. I(3))**

**Definition**  
A _reciprocity reservation_ is a formal declaration made by a Contracting State under **New York Convention Art. I(3)** stating that it will **apply the Convention only to awards made in the territory of other Contracting States**.  
It limits the Convention’s scope to **“mutual” contracting-state relationships**.

It is one of only **two permissible reservations** under the NYC.

---

## **Core Features**

### **1. Reciprocity reservation (geographical limitation)**

A State may declare that it will apply the Convention:

- **Only to awards made in another Contracting State**  
    → Awards from non-Contracting States must rely on **domestic enforcement law**, not the NYC.
    

This ensures **reciprocal treatment** between contracting parties.

### **2. Commercial reservation** (often paired with reciprocity)

A State may choose to apply the NYC **only to “commercial” disputes** as defined under its own national law.

---

## **Purpose**

- Introduces **predictability**: courts apply the NYC only to awards originating in other NYC jurisdictions.
    
- Protects States from extending Convention benefits to non-signatories.
    
- Reduces enforcement exposure for States with restrictive arbitration policies.

## **What Reciprocity Reservations _are_**

- A **permissible treaty opt-in limitation** under Art. I(3).
    
- A mechanism to align recognition/enforcement obligations with **treaty membership**.
    
- A filtering rule applied **at the enforcement stage**.
    

---

## **What They _are not_**

- Not a defence for refusing enforcement of awards from Contracting States.
    
- Not applicable to domestic awards; applies **only to foreign awards**.
    
- Not an override of the seat law; they affect **enforcement**, not **annulment**.
    

---

## **Practical Operation**

When a State has made a reciprocity reservation, its courts:

- **Apply the NYC** to awards made in Contracting States.
    
- **Do not** apply NYC to awards made in non-Contracting States.  
    → But such awards may still be enforceable under **national arbitration law**.
    

The reservation never affects **recognition of the arbitration agreement** under NYC Art. II.

---

## **Examples**

- **United States**:  
    Applies the NYC only to awards “made in the territory of another Contracting State.”  
    → Awards from Contracting States like France, UK, Singapore = covered.  
    → Awards from non-Contracting jurisdictions = handled under FAA Ch. 2 or state law.
    
- **China**:  
    Applies both **reciprocity** and **commercial** reservations.
    
- **Denmark** (EU Member States):  
    Also declared reciprocity; applies NYC only to awards from Contracting States.

## **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Reciprocity reservations allow NYC Contracting States to **restrict Convention coverage** to awards originating in other Contracting States. They shape **enforcement strategy**, but they do **not** limit recognition of arbitration agreements or reduce the enforceability of awards from non-signatory States under domestic law.
