### **Injunctive Relief (general definition – arbitration & cross-border litigation)**

**Injunctive relief** refers to **court-ordered or tribunal-ordered commands** requiring a party to **do** or **refrain from doing** something on an urgent or protective basis.  
It is a **core form of interim relief** designed to prevent harm, preserve rights, or maintain procedural integrity pending the final decision.

It exists in both **national courts** and **international arbitration**.

## **Types of Injunctive Relief**

### **1. Prohibitory injunctions**

- Suspend calls on bank guarantees
    
- Prohibit IP infringement
    

### **2. Mandatory injunctions**

Order a party **to do** something.  
Examples:

- Deliver confidential documents
    
- Restore access to systems
    
- Reinstate supply obligations
    

### **3. Freezing orders / Mareva injunctions**

Specialised orders preventing **asset dissipation**.

### **4. Anti-suit injunctions**

### **5. Emergency or interim orders**

Tribunal or emergency arbitrator may issue urgent relief prior to constitution of the full tribunal.

## **Injunctive Relief in Arbitration**

- Authorised under most institutional rules (ICC, LCIA, SIAC, UNCITRAL).
    
- Tribunals may grant interim measures with **binding effect**.
    
- Courts at the **seat** or in aid of arbitration may also grant injunctions.
    
- Enforcement typically relies on national law (lex fori executionis).

- A tool preserving rights, assets, evidence, and procedural harmony.
    
- A mechanism preventing **frustration** of the final award.

## **What It _is not_**

- Not a substitute for damages or final remedies.
    
- Not a merits determination.
    
- Not unlimited—subject to:  
    – proportionality  
    – necessity  
    – security requirements  
    – compatibility with lex arbitri and public policy
