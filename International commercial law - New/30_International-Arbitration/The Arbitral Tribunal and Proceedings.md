# [[The Arbitral Tribunal and Proceedings]]

## Course themes (source: [[ICL emne fra bøger]])
- Tribunal constitution, qualifications, independence/impartiality, challenge/replacement procedures, competence-competence, case management powers, hearings, submissions, evidence handling, confidentiality, and procedural directions

## Seat-driven supervision (source: [[Seat of arbitration]])
The seat of arbitration is the legal home of the proceedings. It determines the lex arbitri, supervisory courts (appointment assistance, interim measures, annulment), and the award’s nationality. Hearings may occur elsewhere, but the seat anchors tribunal oversight and due process obligations.

## Jurisdictional authority (source: [[Competence-competence doctrine]])
The tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction (existence, validity, scope of the arbitration agreement) under Model Law Art. 16. Courts retain ultimate review at the annulment or enforcement stage, preserving efficiency while safeguarding legal control.

## Procedural outputs (sources: [[Arbitral Award#Award typology|Interim awards]]; [[Arbitral Award#Award typology|Jurisdictional awards]]; [[Arbitral Award#Award typology|Default award]])
- **Interim awards** decide preliminary or procedural issues (e.g., jurisdiction) and may be enforceable depending on the lex arbitri
- **Jurisdictional awards** confirm or deny tribunal competence, subject to later court review
- **Default awards** issue when one party fails to participate provided due process (notice/opportunity to be heard) is satisfied

## Case management tools (source: [[Injunctive relief]])
Tribunals (and supportive courts) may grant injunctive relief—prohibitory or mandatory orders, freezing measures, anti-suit directions, emergency protections—to prevent irreparable harm, preserve assets, or secure evidence while proceedings continue.
