### **Curial Law (general definition)**

**Curial law** is the **procedural law governing the conduct of an arbitration**, distinct from both the **lex arbitri** (mandatory seat law) and the **institutional rules** chosen by the parties.

It regulates the _day-to-day procedure_ of the arbitration.

## **Core Components**

- **Procedural framework chosen by the parties**  
    Often the rules of an arbitral institution (e.g., ICC Rules, LCIA Rules, SCC Rules) or ad hoc rules (e.g., UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules).
    
- **Operational layer of procedure**  
    Covers:  
    – Timetables  
    – Submissions  
    – Document production  
    – Evidence  
    – Hearings  
    – Tribunal conduct  
    – Costs procedure
    
- **Subordinate to lex arbitri**  
    Curial law cannot override **mandatory provisions** of the seat’s arbitration statute (e.g., due process, tribunal appointment rules, annulment regime).

## **What Curial Law _is_**

- The **procedural rulebook** directly applied by the tribunal during the proceedings.
    
- Typically the **institutional rules** if the arbitration is institutional.
    
- In ad hoc arbitration, the **UNCITRAL Rules** or bespoke procedural agreements.
    
- The “**internal procedure**” of the arbitration.

## **What It _is not_**

- Not the **lex arbitri** (mandatory procedural law tied to the seat).
    
- Not the **lex contractus** (substantive governing law of the contract).
    
- Not the **law chosen to govern the arbitration agreement** (which may differ).
    
- Not a source of court powers—those come from the seat’s law.

## **Hierarchy of Applicable Laws in Arbitration**

1. **Lex arbitri (seat law)** – mandatory procedural backbone
    
2. **Curial law** – procedural rules chosen by parties (institutional or ad hoc)
    
3. **Lex contractus** – substantive governing law
    
4. **Law governing arbitration agreement** – validity & interpretation of clause
    

Curial law sits at **Level 2**.

## **Examples**

- ICC arbitration seated in London  
    – **Lex arbitri:** English Arbitration Act 1996  
    – **Curial law:** ICC Arbitration Rules  
    – **Lex contractus:** New York law  
    – **Law governing arbitration agreement:** English law (if clause so provides)
    
- Ad hoc arbitration in Copenhagen  
    – **Lex arbitri:** Danish Arbitration Act  
    – **Curial law:** UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules  
    – Tribunal follows UNCITRAL procedure but must comply with Danish mandatory provisions.

## **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Curial law is the **procedural operating system** of the arbitration—chosen by the parties, applied by the tribunal, and subordinated to the mandatory rules of the seat. It drives the practical mechanics of how the arbitration is carried out.
