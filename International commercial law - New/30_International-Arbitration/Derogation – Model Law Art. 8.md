### **Derogation – Model Law Art. 8 (derogation from court jurisdiction)**

**Definition**  
Under **UNCITRAL Model Law Art. 8**, “derogation” refers to the parties’ **agreement to remove (derogate from) the jurisdiction of national courts** and submit disputes to **arbitration instead**.  
National courts must **respect this derogation** by referring the parties to arbitration when seized of a matter covered by an arbitration agreement.

It is the Model Law’s **core pro-arbitration referral mechanism**.

## **Core Rule (Art. 8(1) Model Law)**

If an action is brought before a court **in a matter that is the subject of an arbitration agreement**, the court:

1. **Must refer the parties to arbitration**,
    
2. **Unless** the arbitration agreement is  
    – _null_,  
    – _void_,  
    – _inoperative_, or  
    – _incapable of being performed_.
    

This is the legal effect of **derogation**:  
**parties remove national court jurisdiction by agreeing to arbitrate.**

---

## **Operational Effects**

- Courts cannot proceed with the merits of the dispute.
    
- Court’s only permissible review is **prima facie** validity of the arbitration agreement.
    
- Arbitral tribunals retain primary jurisdiction under the  
    → **[[Competence-competence doctrine]]**.
    
- Proceedings continue in arbitration even if the court is seized first.

## **What Derogation _is_**

- A **contractual exclusion** of court jurisdiction (except for supervisory functions).
    
- The mechanism that forces courts to **step aside** in favour of arbitration.
    
- A rule promoting **autonomy** and **enforceability** of arbitration agreements.
    
- A counterpart to the NYC Art. II(3) “refer-to-arbitration” duty.

## **What It _is not_**

- Not a merits determination by the court.
    
- Not an anti-suit injunction.
    
- Not a rule giving courts ongoing supervisory control (that comes from the **lex arbitri** through the **seat**).
    
- Not optional—courts must decline jurisdiction unless the agreement is invalid.
    

---

## **Examples**

- Party sues in national court despite an ICC arbitration clause.  
    → Court must refer to arbitration under Art. 8.
    
- Party alleges contract invalidity; arbitration clause remains separable.  
    → Court must refer to arbitration unless _the clause itself_ is defective.
    
- Arbitration agreement unclear or pathological but salvageable.  
    → Court applies a pro-arbitration interpretation and stays proceedings.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Derogation under Model Law Art. 8 gives **binding effect** to arbitration agreements by compelling courts to **decline jurisdiction** and refer the parties to arbitration unless the clause is clearly invalid. It operationalises party autonomy and forms the **procedural backbone** of modern international arbitration.
