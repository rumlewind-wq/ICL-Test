# Arbitral Award

An **arbitral award** is the binding decision issued by the arbitral tribunal that resolves the substantive claims submitted to arbitration. It gives the award its "nationality" for New York Convention purposes and triggers post-award remedies such as correction, interpretation, annulment, or enforcement.

## Form and enforceability
- Must satisfy the mandatory writing, signature, reasoning, date, and seat requirements under the **lex arbitri** and the [[New York Convention Art. V|New York Convention]]; see [[Formal validity]].
- An **enforceable award** is one that meets these formalities, has been properly notified to the parties, and is final under the seat law, making it capable of recognition under NYC Art. V(1)(e).
- Awards carry [[Res judicata]] effect once final: parties cannot re-litigate the same claims or issues once an award becomes binding.

## Award typology
- **Final award** – disposes of all claims and terminates the tribunal’s mandate on the merits.
- **Partial award** – resolves some but not all issues (e.g., liability); independently enforceable.
- **Interim award** – deals with procedural or preliminary points (including jurisdiction) pending a final decision.
- **Consent award** – records a settlement pursuant to Model Law Art. 30 and is treated as a final award.
- **Declaratory award** – states parties’ rights or obligations without coercive relief.
- **Default award** – issued when a party fails to participate, provided due process safeguards are respected.
- **Jurisdictional award** – affirms or declines tribunal competence.
- **Costs award** – allocates arbitration costs, fees, and expenses.
- **Interest award** – grants pre- and/or post-award interest on monetary relief.

## Post-award control
- **Correction/interpretation/additional awards**: lex arbitri or institutional rules allow limited adjustments after issuance.
- **Annulment**: see [[Model Law Art. 34 – annulment]] and [[Invalidity and Setting-Aside of Arbitral Awards]] for available seat-court challenges.
- **Vacated awards**: when an award is annulled at the seat, enforcement courts may refuse recognition under NYC Art. V(1)(e).

## NYC Art. V / Model Law Art. 34 grounds linked to awards
- **Public policy (Model Law Art. 34(2)(b)(ii))** – seat courts may annul and enforcement courts may refuse recognition if the award violates fundamental procedural fairness, involves corruption or fraud, or offends the forum’s basic legal principles.
- **Ultra petita or procedural defects** – relief beyond the submission agreement or breaches of due process fall under Art. 34(2)(a)(iii) and NYC Art. V(1)(b–d); see [[Ultra petita – Art. 34(2)(a)(iii)]] and [[No review of merits rule]].
- **Non-arbitrable subject matter** – certain disputes (e.g., status, criminal matters, public law) remain off-limits; see [[Subject-matter non-arbitrable – Art. 34(2)(b)(i)]].
- **Improper composition or procedure** – deviations from the parties’ agreement or mandatory lex arbitri rules enable challenges; see [[Derogation – Model Law Art. 8]] and [[Interim measures]] for due process considerations.

## Relationship with enforcement
- NYC Art. III–V governs cross-border enforcement; see [[Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards (New York Convention)]].
- National courts may refuse enforcement if the award exceeds the submission agreement, violates due process, or has been suspended/annulled at the seat.

## Practical notes for exam preparation
- Identify the award’s seat and institutional rules to determine which courts supervise post-award remedies.
- Distinguish final/partial/interim awards when discussing enforceability or res judicata.
- Always reference whether a challenge is brought at the seat (annulment) or at the enforcement stage (NYC defences).
