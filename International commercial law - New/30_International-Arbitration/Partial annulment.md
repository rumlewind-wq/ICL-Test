### **Partial Annulment (general definition)**

**Partial annulment** occurs when a court at the **seat of arbitration** sets aside **only part of an arbitral award**, while the remaining sections **remain valid and enforceable**. It is an application of the **principle of severability of award components**.

## **Core Characteristics**

- **Selective invalidation**  
    Only the defective portion of the award is annulled—typically where:  
    – Tribunal exceeded its mandate (ultra petita)  
    – Procedural irregularities affect only some claims  
    – Jurisdiction existed for some issues but not others
    
- **Preserves enforceable sections**  
    Valid segments survive and may be recognised under the **New York Convention**.
    
- **Recognised in the Model Law**  
    – **Model Law Art. 34(2)(a)(iii)** expressly allows partial annulment if the award’s  
    invalid parts are “severable.”

## **What Partial Annulment _is_**

- A **targeted intervention** by the supervisory court.
    
- A mechanism to uphold the **maximum effective portion** of an award.
    
- A tool for respecting party autonomy and arbitration finality.
    
- A reflection of the principle that procedural or jurisdictional error need not contaminate the entire award.

## **What It _is not_**

- Not a merits review—court does **not** reassess substantive correctness.
    
- Not a re-arbitration; the court only removes defective parts.
    
- Not available when the invalid portion is **inseparable** from the rest.
    
- Not a substitute for appeal (arbitration awards generally lack merits appeals).

## **Typical Scenarios Triggering Partial Annulment**

- **Tribunal decides issues outside the arbitration agreement**  
    → Only the excess-of-mandate section is annulled.
    
- **Procedural defect affecting only one claim**  
    → Remaining claims stand.
    
- **Multi-claim or multi-party awards with segmented reasoning**  
    → Court annuls defective claim but keeps others intact.
    
- **Damages quantum partially unsupported**  
    → Only the invalid damages component is annulled (depends on jurisdiction).

## **Effects on Enforcement**

- Enforcement courts recognise:  
    – **Valid portions**: enforceable under NYC  
    – **Annulled portions**: enforcement may be refused under **NYC Art. V(1)(e)**
    
- Enforcement authorities **must respect** the seat court’s partial annulment determination (award’s “nationality”).
    

---

## **Examples**

- Tribunal awards damages on three claims; one claim exceeds the arbitration clause’s scope.  
    → Court annuls only that claim (excess of jurisdiction).
    
- Only one respondent was improperly notified.  
    → Award annulled **only** as to that respondent.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Partial annulment is a **precision tool** of supervisory courts, removing only the defective sections of an award while preserving enforceability of the remainder. It reinforces arbitration finality and limits judicial interference to the **minimal necessary extent**.
