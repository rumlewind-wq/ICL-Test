# [[Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards (New York Convention)]]

## Pro-enforcement architecture (source: [[ICL emne fra bøger]])
- Global enforcement regime with a pro-enforcement bias, built on recognition vs. enforcement distinctions, exhaustive refusal grounds in Art. V, and reliance on national execution law (lex fori executionis)
- NYC reservations: reciprocity and commercial declarations under Art. I(3); no revision au fond

## Exhaustive refusal grounds (source: [[New York Convention Art. V]])
- Art. V(1)(a–e): invalid agreement, lack of notice/due process, excess of authority, improper tribunal composition/procedure, award not yet binding or set aside
- Art. V(2)(a–b): non-arbitrability and public policy (courts may examine ex officio)

## Reservations and declarations
- **Reciprocity (sources: [[Reciprocity]]; [[Reciprocity reservations under NYC]]; [[Reciprocity reservation – Art. I(3)]])**: States may declare the Convention applies only to awards made in other Contracting States; awards from non-signatories fall back on domestic law
- **Commercial reservation (source: [[Commercial reservation under NYC|Commercial reservation – Art. I(3)]])**: States may limit NYC application to disputes arising out of “commercial” relationships as defined by their own law

## Structural principles (sources: [[Revision au fond]]; [[No review of merits rule]])
- Enforcement courts may not review the merits of arbitral awards; Art. V is exhaustive and prohibits re-evaluating facts, law, or damages
- Révision au fond is barred, ensuring only procedural/jurisdictional defences are tested

## Enforcement outcomes (sources: [[Voluntary compliance]]; [[Forced compliance]])
- Many awards are satisfied voluntarily once parties recognise NYC enforceability
- If voluntary compliance fails, creditors seek recognition in the enforcement State and pursue forced execution (asset seizure, garnishment) under domestic procedures, armed with the NYC order
