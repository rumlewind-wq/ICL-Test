**Institutional arbitration (general definition)**  
Institutional arbitration is arbitration **administered by a recognised arbitral institution**, which provides **procedural rules, administrative support, case management, fee schedules, and organisational infrastructure**.

It is a structured, rule-based model contrasting with ad hoc arbitration.

### **Core Characteristics**

- **Administered by an institution**  
    Common institutions:  
    – ICC  
    – LCIA  
    – SCC  
    – SIAC  
    – HKIAC  
    – ICDR  
    – Danish Institute of Arbitration (DIA)
    
- **Predefined institutional rules**  
    The arbitration follows the institution’s rules (e.g., **ICC Rules**, **LCIA Rules**), covering:  
    – Appointment of arbitrators  
    – Challenges to arbitrators  
    – Procedural framework  
    – Time limits and case management  
    – Costs and fee schedules
    
- **Administrative support**  
    Institutions provide:  
    – Secretariat/case manager oversight  
    – Procedural monitoring  
    – Appointment services  
    – Financial management of tribunal fees  
    – Scrutiny of awards (ICC hallmark)

    Institutions ensure compliance with:  
    – Due process  
    – Proper constitution of tribunal

### **What Institutional Arbitration _is_**

- A **structured, professionally managed** form of arbitration.
    
- A system where the institution contributes **predictability**, **procedural oversight**, and **administrative continuity**.
    
- A model where institutional rules interact with the **lex arbitri** to create a stable procedural environment.

### **What It _is not_**

- Not ad hoc (no self-management).
    
- Not a court—institutions **administer**, they do not **adjudicate**.
    
- Not immune from the lex arbitri; seat law still governs validity and annulment.
    
- Not automatically faster or cheaper; depends on the institution and case complexity.

### **Examples**

- “All disputes shall be settled by arbitration under the **ICC Rules**, seated in Paris.”  
    – ICC administers the case, appoints or confirms arbitrators, manages filings, and scrutinises the draft award.
    
- “Disputes shall be resolved under the **LCIA Arbitration Rules**, seat London.”  
    – LCIA handles appointments, challenges, and procedural administration.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Institutional arbitration embeds the arbitration process within a **professional, rule-based administrative framework**, reducing procedural risk and enhancing enforceability through consistent case management, while still relying on the **lex arbitri** of the seat for ultimate legal oversight.
