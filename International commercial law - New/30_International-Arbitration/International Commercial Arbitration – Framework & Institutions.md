# [[International Commercial Arbitration – Framework & Institutions]]

## Course overview (source: [[ICL emne fra bøger]])
- Nature and defining characteristics of arbitration (consent, nongovernmental decision makers, final and binding awards)
- Advantages/disadvantages versus litigation
- Regulatory framework: [[UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration]], [[UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules]], institutional rules
- Ad hoc vs. institutional models, major institutions (ICC, LCIA, SCC, SIAC, HKIAC, ICDR, Danish Institute of Arbitration)
- State-involved arbitration distinctions and alternative dispute resolution references (mediation, conciliation, neutral evaluation, expert determination)

## Arbitration vs. litigation (source: [[Arbitration]])
- Arbitration is private, confidential, and flexible; litigation is public with strict procedural rules
- Arbitrators are chosen by the parties and may be subject-matter experts; judges are assigned by courts
- Arbitration awards are final with limited appeal grounds; litigation offers multilayer appeals
- Enforceability: arbitral awards benefit from the [[New York Convention]]; court judgments rely on reciprocal treaties or regulations

## Institutional vs. ad hoc administration
- **Ad hoc arbitration (source: [[Ad hoc arbitration]])**: no administering institution, parties manage procedure (often using UNCITRAL Rules), and the lex arbitri supplies mandatory safeguards via the seat’s courts
- **Institutional arbitration (source: [[Institutional arbitration]])**: administered by bodies like ICC/LCIA/SIAC/SCC/HKIAC/ICDR/DIA, featuring rulebooks, case management, arbitrator appointment services, cost schedules, and award scrutiny (e.g., ICC)

## Arbitrability baseline (sources: [[Arbitrability]]; [[Common non-arbitrable areas]])
- Arbitrability defines which disputes may be resolved by arbitration (objective and subjective limits)
- Non-arbitrable subject matter typically includes criminal law, family status, insolvency proceedings, patent validity (erga omnes), administrative/regulatory decisions, antitrust fines, and certain labour or consumer matters
- Arbitrability is assessed under both the lex arbitri and the enforcement state’s law (NYC Art. V(2)(a)); consent cannot override statutory prohibitions
