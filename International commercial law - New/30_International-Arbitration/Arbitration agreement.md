# Arbitration Agreement

An arbitration agreement is a **contractual commitment** by which parties agree to submit present or future disputes to arbitration instead of national courts. It can appear as a clause in a wider commercial contract or as a stand-alone submission agreement and constitutes the jurisdictional gateway for the arbitral tribunal.

## Core characteristics
- Transfers adjudicative authority from state courts to a private tribunal chosen by the parties.
- Protects procedural autonomy: parties can select the seat, institutional or ad hoc rules, tribunal composition, and governing law for the merits.
- Benefits from the [[Separability doctrine]] and the [[Competence-competence doctrine]], so the clause survives most attacks on the main contract and empowers the tribunal to rule on its own jurisdiction.
- Enforceable worldwide under the [[New York Convention Art. V|New York Convention]] (Art. II) and national arbitration statutes.

## Validity layers
- **Formal validity** – see [[Formal validity]] for writing, signature, reasoning, and notification requirements under the lex arbitri and the New York Convention.
- **Substantive validity** – see [[Substantive validity]] and [[Material validity]] for how nullity, incapacity, duress, illegality, or scope objections are tested.
- **Overall validity checks** – [[Validity of arbitration agreements]] consolidates the different legal tests applied by courts at the seat and at the enforcement stage.

## Drafting focus areas
- Specify the **seat**, governing **institutional rules**, language, and appointment method to avoid [[Pathological arbitration clauses]].
- Ensure the clause covers the intended legal relationship(s) and future disputes, including non-contractual claims when relevant.
- Consider multi-tier clauses (negotiation/mediation followed by arbitration) and carve-outs for urgent relief before national courts.

## Extensions and third parties
- Non-signatories may be bound via agency, estoppel, assumption, assignment, group-of-companies theories, or piercing the corporate veil (jurisdiction-specific).
- Pay attention to asymmetrical clauses or unilateral options because some jurisdictions limit their enforceability.

## Arbitrability filters
- Confirm that the subject matter is arbitrable under the law of the seat and any likely enforcement jurisdiction (see [[Arbitrability.md|Arbitrability]] and [[Subject-matter non-arbitrable – Art. 34(2)(b)(i)]]).
- Public policy and mandatory rules may still limit the effect of the agreement, especially in regulated sectors or consumer/employment contexts.

## Interaction with courts
- Courts seized despite a valid arbitration clause should stay or dismiss proceedings, compelling arbitration unless the agreement is null, void, inoperable, or incapable of being performed.
- Supportive measures such as interim relief, evidence taking, or appointment of arbitrators are typically available under the lex arbitri; see [[Interim measures]] and [[Injunctive relief]].
