# [[Choice of Law for Non-Contractual Obligations (Rome II Regulation)]]

## Core coverage (source: [[ICL emne fra bøger]])
- Scope and exclusions of Rome II
- General rule: **lex loci damni** (law of the country where the damage occurs)
- Specific tort categories: product liability, unfair competition, environmental damage, intellectual property, traffic accidents
- Freedom of choice for tort claims, plus special provisions for unjust enrichment, negotiorum gestio, and culpa in contrahendo
- Overriding mandatory rules and public policy limitations

## Methodological parallel (source: [[Choice of law circles]])
- Pre-contractual liability (Rome II Art. 12) follows the same three-circle approach: (1) explicit agreement, (2) default connecting factor (closest relationship with both parties’ habitual residence), (3) escape clause for manifestly closer connections; overriding mandatory rules remain outside the circles

## Interaction notes
- Pre-contractual liability is excluded from Rome I (see [[Scope exclusions – Rome I]]) and therefore governed by Rome II
- Capacity issues continue to depend on domestic PIL (see [[Law applicable to Capacity → default PIL rules]]) when assessing tort parties’ legal ability
