### **Fraude à la Loi (general definition – private international law)**

**Fraude à la loi** is the doctrine that **parties may not manipulate connecting factors** (residence, nationality, place of contracting, forum choice, etc.) **with the intention of evading a mandatory rule** of the legal system that would otherwise apply.  
When such manipulation occurs, courts **disregard the artificial connection** and **re-apply the law that would have governed** absent the fraud.

It is a **public-policy safeguard** against abusive forum or law shopping.

## **Core Meaning**

A party commits _fraude à la loi_ when it:

- Artificially changes a connecting factor (e.g., domicile, incorporation seat)
    
- For the _sole purpose_ of avoiding  
    – a mandatory legal rule  
    – a public-order provision  
    – a statutory protection
    
- Without a genuine economic or social connection to the alternate legal system.
    

If proven → courts neutralise the manoeuvre.

## **Where It Operates**

- **Conflict-of-laws** (choice of law)  
    → Courts ignore artificially created connecting factors.
    
- **Jurisdiction**  
    → Courts reject manipulative relocation to create or avoid jurisdiction.
    
- **Company law**  
    → Use of foreign incorporation to escape mandatory domestic rules may be disregarded (more limited in the EU due to freedom of establishment).
    
- **Family law**  
    → Quick foreign divorces to circumvent domestic rules may be refused recognition.

## **What Fraude à la Loi _is_**

- A **public-policy exception** preventing abuse of private international law.
    
- A doctrine allowing courts to **restore the original legal connection**.
    
- A means to protect **mandatory rules** from circumvention.
    
- A widely recognised concept in civil-law jurisdictions (e.g., France, Belgium, Luxembourg).

## **What It _is not_**

- Not ordinary forum shopping — only **bad-faith, artificial, and purpose-built** manipulation qualifies.
    
- Not a prohibition on choosing favourable laws when the connection is legitimate.
    
- Not a merits review — it concerns the _authenticity_ of connecting factors.
    
- Not generally applicable within **EU freedoms** (free movement limits the doctrine’s use in company and contract law).

## **Examples**

- A couple briefly relocates to a foreign jurisdiction solely to obtain a divorce not permitted at home.  
    → Home court may refuse recognition on _fraude à la loi_ grounds.
    
- A company reincorporates abroad for one week to avoid mandatory capital requirements.  
    → Court may disregard the foreign incorporation if connection is artificial.
    
- A party signs a contract in Country X (one-day trip) only to trigger a more favourable conflict rule.  
    → Court may apply the law of the country with real connections instead.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Fraude à la loi prevents parties from **manufacturing artificial international connections** to escape mandatory rules. Courts neutralise the manipulation and apply the **substantively appropriate law**, protecting the integrity of private international law.
