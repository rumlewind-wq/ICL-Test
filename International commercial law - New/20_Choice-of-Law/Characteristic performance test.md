### **Characteristic Performance Test (Rome I / Rome Convention)**

**Definition**  
The characteristic performance test is the **default rule** used under the Rome Convention (Art. 4) and Rome I (Art. 4(2)) to identify the **law most closely connected to a contract** when the parties have **not chosen** the governing law.

It determines which party performs the **characteristic** (non-monetary, defining) obligation of the contract and assigns the applicable law based on that party’s **habitual residence**.

---

### **Core Mechanism**

- Identify the party whose performance is **characteristic** of the contract type.
    
- Apply the **habitual residence** (Rome I) or **principal place of business** of that party as the connecting factor.
    
- Used only **in absence of a choice-of-law clause** (Art. 3).
    

This creates a **predictable, functionally neutral** default rule.

### **Examples of Characteristic Performance**

- **Sales contract** → Seller’s habitual residence
    
- **Service contract** → Service provider’s habitual residence
    
- **Franchise contract** → Franchisor’s habitual residence
    
- **Distribution contract** → Distributor’s habitual residence (Rome I, Art. 4(1)(f))
    
- **Loan agreement** → Lender’s habitual residence
    
- **Insurance contract** → Insurer’s habitual residence (unless Art. 7 applies)

### **What the Test _is_**

- A **connecting-factor tool** for determining the applicable law absent party choice.
    
- An instrument to find the **economic centre of gravity** of the contract.
    
- A rule favouring the **performer of the defining obligation**, not the payer.

### **What It _is not_**

- Not a merits-based or fairness analysis.
    
- Not applicable when Rome I Art. 4(1) provides **specific rules** (carriage, consumer, insurance, franchise, distribution, employment, etc.).
    
- Not available when parties have chosen the law (Art. 3).
    
- Not for pre-contractual liability (Rome II, not Rome I).

### **Interaction With Escape Clause**

- If the characteristic-performance rule leads to an **artificial result**, courts may use:  
    – **Rome I, Art. 4(3)** → _Closer connection escape clause_  
    This overrides the default test.

### **Illustrative Example**

- A German engineering firm provides services to a Danish company.
    
- No choice-of-law clause.
    
- **Characteristic performance = engineering services**.
    
- **Habitual residence = Germany**.  
    → German law applies (subject to Art. 4(3)).

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

The characteristic performance test is the **core fallback mechanism** in Rome I for identifying the applicable law to a contract when the parties have not specified one. It anchors the contract to the jurisdiction of the party performing the **substantive, defining obligation**, thereby promoting predictability and commercial efficiency.
