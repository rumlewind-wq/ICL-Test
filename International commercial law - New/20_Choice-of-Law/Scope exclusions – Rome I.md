### **What these exclusions _mean_**

- Rome I **does not determine** the applicable law for these categories.
    
- Other EU instruments, the Rome II Regulation, domestic PIL rules, or special regimes apply instead.
    
- Rome I still covers **purely contractual obligations**, but not issues tied to public registers, legal status, corporate structure, etc.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Rome I governs **contractual obligations only**. Anything touching **status, corporate structure, succession, negotiable instruments, arbitration/jurisdiction, trusts, or pre-contractual liability** falls outside scope and requires separate legal analysis under specialised regimes.
