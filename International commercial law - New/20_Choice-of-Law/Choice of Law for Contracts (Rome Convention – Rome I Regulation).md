# [[Choice of Law for Contracts (Rome Convention / Rome I Regulation)]]

## Overview (source: [[ICL emne fra bøger]])
- Scope and exclusions, party autonomy (express + implied choice), objective connecting factors, weak-party rules, overriding mandatory provisions, and the substantive reach of the applicable law
- Coverage includes formal/material validity, assignment, subrogation, insurance contracts, and coordination with Brussels I jurisdiction

## Regulation roadmap (source: [[Bestemmelseoversigt ICL]])
- **Art. 2** universal application; **Art. 3** party autonomy
- **Art. 4** default rules via characteristic performance and escape clause
- **Art. 6** consumer contracts, **Art. 7** insurance, **Art. 8** employment
- **Art. 9** overriding mandatory provisions

## Methodology (source: [[Choice of law circles]])
1. **Party autonomy (Art. 3)** – express or clearly implied choice controls
2. **Default connecting factors (Art. 4)** – specific categories plus characteristic performance
3. **Escape clause (Art. 4(3))** – manifestly closer connection overrides default outcomes
Overriding mandatory rules and public policy sit outside these circles as ultimate corrections.

## Party choice and implication (source: [[Implied choice of law]])
Rome I recognises implied choice when the intention to choose a law is clearly demonstrated by contract terms or circumstances (jurisdiction clauses, legal terminology, prior dealings, industry forms). Clear indicators displace Art. 4 defaults and confirm party autonomy even without an express clause.

## Default connecting factors
- **Characteristic performance test (source: [[Characteristic performance test]])**: identifies the party performing the defining obligation (seller, service provider, franchisor, lender, etc.) and applies that party’s habitual residence when no choice is made
- **Seller’s law principle (source: [[Seller’s law principle]])**: for sales contracts the seller’s habitual residence governs because the seller performs the characteristic (non-monetary) obligation
- **Closest connection test (source: [[Closest connection test]])**: Art. 4(3)/(4) allows courts to apply the law of the country with the contract’s closest factual and economic links when specific categories do not fit or would yield artificial results
- **Escape clause (source: [[Escape clause]])**: corrective mechanism permitting departure from Art. 4(1)–(2) where another country is manifestly more closely connected, based on objective indicators (common residence, integrated transaction, centralised operations)

## Scope limits and capacity (sources: [[Scope exclusions – Rome I]]; [[Law applicable to Capacity → default PIL rules]])
- Rome I excludes status/capacity of natural persons, family obligations, wills/succession, negotiable instruments, arbitration agreements, jurisdiction clauses, company law matters, authority of agents, trusts, and culpa in contrahendo (handled by Rome II)
- Capacity remains governed by each forum’s domestic PIL (lex patriae, lex domicilii, or hybrids); Rome I neither harmonises capacity nor overrides national conflict rules

## Assignment and subrogation (source: [[Assignment and subrogation]])
- **Assignment**: the assignor–assignee relationship is governed by the law applicable to the assignment contract (Art. 14(1)), while the debtor–assignee relationship remains under the law governing the original claim (Art. 14(2)); priority and proprietary effects fall outside Rome I
- **Subrogation** (Art. 15): the law governing the original obligation also governs whether subrogation occurs and its scope, ensuring the payer steps into the creditor’s rights under that substantive law
