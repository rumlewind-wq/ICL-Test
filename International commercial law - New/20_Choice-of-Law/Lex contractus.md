**Lex contractus — concise operational definition**

**Definition**  
The _lex contractus_ is the **substantive law governing the parties’ contract**. It determines **rights, obligations, remedies, validity, interpretation, breach, and damages**. It is selected by party autonomy or, absent choice, by conflict-of-law rules (e.g., Rome I Regulation in the EU).

**What it _is_**

- **The governing law of the contract**, chosen by the parties (“This Agreement is governed by English law”).
    
- **The source of substantive rules** applied to interpret the agreement, assess performance, breach, causation, and remedies.
    
- **A Rome I concept** determining which national legal system governs the contract when parties disagree.
    
- **Independent of arbitration/litigation procedure** (it governs substance, not procedure).
    

**What it _is not_**

- **Not the lex arbitri** (the procedural law of the arbitral seat).
    
- **Not institutional rules** (ICC, LCIA, UNCITRAL Rules are _procedural frameworks_, not substantive law).
    
- **Not “general principles of international law”** unless expressly chosen.
    
- **Not automatically the law of the seat** (seat law governs procedure; contract law governs substance).
    

**Examples**

- Parties choose **English law** as governing law in an ICC arbitration seated in Stockholm.
    
    - **Lex contractus = English law**
        
    - **Lex arbitri = Swedish Arbitration Act**
        
- No governing-law clause in an EU B2B contract.
    
    - Under **Rome I**, default rule selects the law of the **characteristic performer** (e.g., seller’s habitual residence).
        
- A supply contract selects **New York law**.
    
    - Substantive issues (interpretation, warranties, damages) are decided under NY law, even if the arbitration is seated in Paris.
        

**Corporate-grade takeaway**  
Lex contractus is the contract’s **substantive rulebook**. It drives commercial outcomes, governs liability, and shapes the risk matrix. It is distinct from all procedural frameworks and determined by party choice—or, failing that, Rome I.
