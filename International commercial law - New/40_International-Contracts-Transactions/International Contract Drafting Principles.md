# International Contract Drafting Principles

> Checklist for structuring cross-border commercial agreements. Populate with preferred clauses, negotiation tactics, and risk mitigation tools.

## Structure to complete
1. **Governing law & jurisdiction** – align with [[Choice of Law Hub]] and [[International Arbitration Hub]].
2. **Performance obligations** – delivery, milestones, payment currencies, hardship clauses.
3. **Risk transfer** – Incoterms references, force majeure, material adverse change.
4. **Compliance & ESG** – sanctions, anti-corruption, data protection.
5. **Dispute resolution** – arbitration vs litigation pathways, multi-tier clauses, emergency relief.
6. **Enforcement planning** – asset localisation, security, guarantees, escrow.

## Workflow tips
- Link to due diligence data inside [[assignments]] or future diligence folders.
- Use this template when generating AI-assisted drafts via Codex automation (see [[Repository Governance]]).
