# CISG Overview

> Placeholder overview for the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). Populate with article-by-article summaries when preparing exam notes.

## Structure to populate
1. **Scope and applicability** – Art. 1–6, reservations, exclusion clauses.
2. **Formation** – Part II (offers, acceptances, battle of forms).
3. **Obligations** – Seller (delivery, conformity, documents) and buyer (payment, taking delivery).
4. **Remedies** – avoidance, specific performance, price reduction, damages, anticipatory breach.
5. **Risk and passing of property** – Incoterms interactions, Part III (risk transfer, carriage obligations).
6. **Relationship with other instruments** – interplay with Rome I, Incoterms, and arbitration clauses.

## Exam hooks
- Note how CISG can be displaced by explicit choice-of-law clauses.
- Flag interaction with [[Choice of Law Hub]] topics (party autonomy, characteristic performance).
