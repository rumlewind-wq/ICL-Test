### **Freezing Clauses (jurisdiction-freezing clauses)**

**Definition**  
Freezing clauses are **contractual mechanisms** used in international litigation to **“freeze” jurisdiction in one designated forum**, preventing parties from initiating proceedings in any alternative court. They operate as a **reinforcement tool** for an exclusive choice-of-court agreement.

They are sometimes referred to as **anti-suit reinforcement clauses**.

## **Core Purpose**

- **Lock jurisdiction** into the chosen court.
    
- **Prevent parallel proceedings** in non-chosen courts.
    
- **Deter tactical forum shopping**.
    
- **Support enforcement strategy** by centralising litigation in a single forum.

## **Typical Clause Structure**

A freezing clause often states that:

- All disputes **must only** be brought in the chosen court.
    
- Parties **shall not** initiate, maintain, or assist proceedings in any other jurisdiction.
    
- If a party breaches this obligation by suing elsewhere, it must **withdraw** such proceedings.
    

This is **contractual reinforcement**, not a substitute for Brussels Ia or Hague 2005 obligations.

## **What Freezing Clauses _are_**

- A **contractual prohibition** against starting proceedings outside the chosen forum.
    
- A clause strengthening an exclusive jurisdiction agreement.
    
- A mechanism used in commercial contracts (finance, distribution, high-value cross-border deals).
    
- Legally enforceable through **damages**, **injunctions**, or **procedural sanctions** depending on the forum.

## **What They _are not_**

- Not an **anti-suit injunction** (which is judicial, not contractual).
    
- Not enforceable in all jurisdictions (EU courts cannot issue anti-suit injunctions under _Brussels Ia_, but contractual damages may still apply).
    
- Not a choice-of-law clause—solely a jurisdiction-fixing tool.
    
- Not a waiver of rights to challenge jurisdiction for nullity, incapacity, or invalidity issues.

## **Interaction With EU Law**

- **Brussels Ia Art. 25** already obliges non-chosen courts to decline jurisdiction.
    
- But freezing clauses add **contractual liability** on top of the Regulation.
    
- EU courts **cannot** issue anti-suit injunctions against other EU courts (**Turner v Grovit**), but:  
    – Freezing clauses remain **valid contractual terms**.  
    – Breach can generate claims for damages.

## **Examples**

- “Each party agrees not to commence or pursue proceedings in any court other than the courts of London.”
    
- “The parties undertake to discontinue any proceedings commenced in any non-designated forum.”

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Freezing clauses are **contractual enforcement devices** that lock litigation into the chosen forum and prevent strategic parallel actions. They operate alongside Brussels Ia and Hague 2005 but add an **extra layer of contractual discipline**, reducing forum-shopping and jurisdictional fragmentation in cross-border disputes.
