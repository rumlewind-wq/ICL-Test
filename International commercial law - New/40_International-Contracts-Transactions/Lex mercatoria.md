### **Lex Mercatoria (general definition)**

_Lex mercatoria_ refers to a body of **transnational commercial norms**, composed of trade usages, general principles of international commerce, soft-law instruments, and standardised commercial practices **not tied to any single national legal system**.  
It is used particularly in **international arbitration** as a neutral, flexible source of substantive rules.

## **What Lex Mercatoria _is_**

- A **non-state normative system** for international commerce.
    
- A toolbox of **standardised rules and principles** recognised in global trade.
    
- Frequently applied by arbitrators when parties choose:  
    – “General principles of law”  
    – “Rules of international commerce”  
    – “Transnational commercial law”  
    – “Lex mercatoria” directly
    
- A mechanism for **neutrality** when parties do not want a national law.

## **What It _is not_**

- Not a codified or unified legal system.
    
- Not a national law → cannot be chosen as governing law under **Rome I** before EU courts.
    
- Not automatically applied without party consent (arbitrators need clear authorisation).
    
- Not immune from public policy review at the enforcement stage.

## **Use in Arbitration**

Arbitrators may apply lex mercatoria when:

- The arbitration clause allows application of “rules of law.”
    
- Parties expressly choose lex mercatoria or UNIDROIT Principles.
    
- Parties fail to choose any law and tribunal selects lex mercatoria as neutral default (allowed under certain rules, e.g., ICC).
    

Awards based on lex mercatoria remain **enforceable** under the New York Convention as long as due process and public policy are respected.

## **Debate Summary** (the “lex mercatoria debate”)

### **Pro-lxm position**

Lex mercatoria is a **functional, coherent, transnational legal order**.

### **Anti-lxm position**

It lacks legal legitimacy and completeness; only **state laws** should qualify.

### **Pragmatic/arbitral position**

Widely accepted in arbitration when chosen by parties; state courts remain more cautious.

---

## **Examples**

- Parties choose **UNIDROIT Principles** as the substantive law of the contract.
    
- INCOTERMS integrated by reference into a sales contract.
    
- Arbitrator fills contractual gaps using general principles of international commercial practice.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

Lex mercatoria provides a **neutral, transnational regulatory framework** for international commerce, heavily used in arbitration but not recognised as a standalone “law” by state courts applying Rome I. It is a **flexible, commercially oriented alternative** to national legal systems in cross-border contracting.
