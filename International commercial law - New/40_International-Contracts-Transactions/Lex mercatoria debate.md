### **Lex Mercatoria Debate (general definition)**

The _lex mercatoria debate_ concerns whether **transnational commercial norms**—customs, principles, model laws, soft law instruments, and general trade usages—can function as an **autonomous body of law** governing international commercial contracts **independently of any national legal system**.

It is a debate about the **existence, legitimacy, and legal status** of an international commercial legal order outside state law.

---

## **Core Issue**

Can parties validly choose “**lex mercatoria**” (or “general principles of international commercial law”) as the **substantive law** of their contract, and can arbitrators apply it as governing law?

---

## **What Lex Mercatoria _is_**

- A body of **non-state commercial norms**, including:  
    – General principles (good faith, pacta sunt servanda)  
    – Trade usages  
    – UNIDROIT Principles  
    – INCOTERMS  
    – CISG interpretations  
    – ICC rules and practices
    
- A **transnational, non-national** normative framework.
    
- Widely recognised in **international arbitration** as applicable substantive standards when chosen by the parties.
    

---

## **What Lex Mercatoria _is not_**

- Not a codified system.
    
- Not a national legal order.
    
- Not universally accepted as a standalone “law” under **state courts** or some legal systems.
    
- Not automatically applicable without party choice (arbitrators must be authorised).

## **Key Positions in the Debate**

### **1. Pro-Lex Mercatoria Position**

Argues that lex mercatoria **exists** as a coherent body of rules capable of governing contracts.  
**Rationale:**

- International commerce requires neutral, uniform standards.
    
- Arbitration practice has created stable principles through repeated usage.
    
- UNIDROIT Principles provide substantive certainty similar to domestic law.
    

**Practical effect:**  
Arbitrators often apply lex mercatoria where parties select “general principles of law,” “international trade law,” or similar formulations.

---

### **2. Anti-Lex Mercatoria Position**

Argues that lex mercatoria is **not a “law”** because it lacks:

- Legitimacy through democratic legislation
    
- Predictability and completeness
    
- Hierarchical structure and enforceability
    

**View:**  
Only **state laws** or **international treaties** qualify as “law” under Rome I and national conflict rules.

---

### **3. Middle-Ground Position (Modern Arbitration Practice)**

Current international arbitration takes a **functional and pragmatic** approach:

- Arbitrators may apply lex mercatoria **if parties expressly choose it**.
    
- State courts often enforce awards applying lex mercatoria (NYC Art. V focuses on due process, not choice of law).
    
- Rome I does **not** permit choosing lex mercatoria as “law”—but arbitration is not bound by Rome I.
    

This hybrid view recognises lex mercatoria as an **arbitral choice**, not a general choice-of-law option in state litigation.

---

## **Interaction with Major Legal Instruments**

- **Rome I Regulation**  
    → Parties must choose the “law of a country”; lex mercatoria **cannot** be chosen as _lex contractus_ before EU courts.
    
- **UNCITRAL Model Law / New York Convention**  
    → More permissive. Arbitrators may apply lex mercatoria if chosen, and awards are enforceable unless public policy is breached.
    
- **Institutional rules** (ICC, LCIA, UNCITRAL Rules)  
    → Allow tribunals to apply “rules of law” chosen by the parties, including non-state norms.
    

---

## **Examples of Lex Mercatoria Use in Arbitration**

- Parties choose **“UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts”** as substantive law.
    
- Parties choose **“general principles of international commercial law”** or **“rules of international trade”**.
    
- Arbitrator fills contractual gaps through widely accepted trade usages (INCOTERMS, UCP 600, ICC customs).
    

All of these are allowed in arbitral practice.

### **Corporate-grade takeaway**

The lex mercatoria debate is a clash between **state-centred** and **transnational** understandings of commercial law. Modern arbitration adopts a **pragmatic acceptance** of lex mercatoria when chosen by parties, while state courts—especially within the EU—remain tied to **national legal systems** under Rome I.
